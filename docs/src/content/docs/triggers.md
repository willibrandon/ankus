description: Handle PostgreSQL row and statement triggers with owned OLD and NEW tuples.
---

Mark a synchronous static method with `[PgTrigger]`. Its single parameter is a
nonnull `PgTriggerContext`. Return `PgHeapTuple?` when the callback can skip a row,
or `PgHeapTuple` when it always returns a row.
Ankus generates a zero-argument SQL function returning `trigger`.
Use `[PgFunction]` alongside the marker for names, schemas, security, search paths,
and dependency identifiers.

```csharp
[PgTrigger]
[PgFunction(Id = "normalize-name")]
public static PgHeapTuple? NormalizeName(PgTriggerContext context)
{
    PgHeapTuple row = context.New
        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("This trigger requires an INSERT or UPDATE row.");
    string? name = row.Get<string?>("name")?.Trim();
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
    {
        return null;
    }

    row.Set("name", name);
    return row;
}
```

Attach the function to a table or view with ordinary SQL. Custom SQL can create
the trigger during extension installation and order it after its table and function:

```csharp
[assembly: PgSql("pet-table", "CREATE TABLE pets (name text NOT NULL);", Relocatable = true)]
[assembly: PgSql("pet-trigger", """
    CREATE TRIGGER normalize_pet BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON pets
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION normalize_name();
    """, Requires = ["pet-table", "normalize-name"], Relocatable = true)]
```

See [custom SQL](/custom-sql/) for dependencies and schema relocation.
`Rows`, `SetMode`, and ordinary SQL parameter/result binding attributes do not
apply to trigger callbacks. Trigger functions cannot be invoked with `SELECT`.

## Context and row ownership

`Operation` is `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, or `Truncate`; `Timing` is `Before`,
`After`, or `InsteadOf`; `Level` is `Row` or `Statement`.
`Event` preserves PostgreSQL's event bits, including deferred-constraint flags.

| Trigger event | `Old` | `New` |
|---|---|---|
| Row INSERT | null | inserted row |
| Row UPDATE | previous row | proposed row |
| Row DELETE | deleted row | null |
| Any statement trigger | null | null |

`Name`, `TriggerOid`, `RelationOid`, `TableName`, and `TableSchema` identify the
current trigger and relation. `Descriptor` describes the relation's physical
columns. `Arguments` contains the exact strings from `EXECUTE FUNCTION f('arg', ...)`.
Arguments are trigger configuration strings, not SQL function parameters.

Rows, descriptors, strings, and arguments are managed copies. They remain valid
after the callback and after further SPI calls. Use the [composite value APIs](/composites/)
to read cells by name or zero-based physical ordinal, change values, and clone rows.
`Clone()` copies cell slots and shares nested reference values.
Row fields use Ankus's supported composite conversions; an unsupported field type
raises an error during row conversion before the managed callback runs.

## Return behavior

| Timing and operation | Return a tuple | Return null |
|---|---|---|
| BEFORE or INSTEAD OF INSERT/UPDATE row | Use the returned row | Skip the row |
| BEFORE or INSTEAD OF DELETE row | Continue deletion; tuple contents are ignored | Skip deletion |
| BEFORE statement | PostgreSQL error `39P01` | Continue |
| AFTER row or statement | Return value ignored | Return value ignored |

Returning OLD from a BEFORE UPDATE still performs an update and fires applicable
AFTER triggers. A nonnull tuple whose fields are all NULL remains a row;
returning null skips it. For an INSTEAD OF trigger, perform the underlying table
changes through SPI and return a tuple to report the handled row.

A replacement INSERT/UPDATE row must match the triggering relation's row type
and physical layout. PostgreSQL enforces field domains and type modifiers;
table constraints are checked by the operation after BEFORE triggers finish.
Exceptions thrown by the callback still abort the statement even when its return
value would have been ignored.

## Generated and dropped columns

A stored generated column in NEW is unavailable during BEFORE triggers because
PostgreSQL computes it afterward. Virtual generated columns, supported by
PostgreSQL 18+, have no physical value in OLD or NEW trigger tuples.
Their descriptor attributes have `IsUnavailable = true`; reading or assigning
these cells throws `InvalidOperationException`. This differs from SQL NULL.

Change ordinary source columns and return the row. PostgreSQL preserves or
recomputes generated values at the appropriate stage. An unavailable trigger
row cannot be sent as an ordinary composite through SPI or a scalar function.
Dropped columns retain their physical slots and remain NULL.

## Transition tables and SPI

`OldTransitionTableName` and `NewTransitionTableName` expose the names requested
by `REFERENCING OLD TABLE AS ... NEW TABLE AS ...`. PostgreSQL determines which
trigger declarations allow transition tables.

Every SPI connection opened during a trigger callback can query its transition
tables. For example, an AFTER INSERT statement trigger can count its inserted rows:

```csharp
string name = context.NewTransitionTableName
    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("A NEW transition table is required.");
long count = Spi.ExecuteScalar<long>($"SELECT count(*) FROM {Spi.QuoteIdentifier(name)}");
```

Stateless queries, `Spi.Connect` sessions, prepared statements, and cursors share
this access. Nested triggers receive their own transition tables; the enclosing
callback's tables remain available when the nested call returns.

Transition tables belong to the current trigger invocation. Cursors opened in
an SPI query environment containing transition tables close when that invocation
ends, including detached cursors. Fetched managed rows remain valid. A retained
plan resolves transition tables against the active invocation when executed; it
does not retain their rows. See [execution and lifetime](/reference/execution/).

Managed exceptions and native SPI errors use the same guarded error boundary as
ordinary functions. Catching a `PgException` from SPI permits subsequent queries
in the callback after the failed operation has rolled back.

The public `samples/Ankus.Examples.Triggers` extension normalizes pet names,
skips blank rows, and demonstrates trigger arguments and ordered installation SQL.
