title: Configuration settings
description: Declare PostgreSQL settings with native storage and typed C# getters.
---

Declare a setting as a static partial getter in a public or internal partial class:

```csharp
public static partial class Settings
{
    [PgGucBool("my_extension.enabled", true, "Enable the extension")]
    public static partial bool Enabled { get; }

    [PgGucInt("my_extension.limit", 100, "Maximum items", Minimum = 1, Maximum = 10000)]
    public static partial int Limit { get; }

    [PgGucString("my_extension.label", null, "Optional label")]
    public static partial string? Label { get; }
}
```

The source generator creates native PostgreSQL storage and implements the getters.
PostgreSQL registers the settings when it loads the library, before calling an
optional `[PgInitialize]` method. Read a getter from an extension callback to obtain
the current native value. Reads outside a backend callback or on another thread
throw `InvalidOperationException`.

Use ordinary SQL configuration commands to change values:

```sql
SET "my_extension.limit" = '250';
SHOW "my_extension.limit";
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL "my_extension.limit" = '50';
ROLLBACK;
RESET "my_extension.limit";
```

PostgreSQL owns parsing, permissions, source priority, transaction and savepoint
restoration, function `SET` clauses, reset values, and configuration reloads.
Custom placeholders set before the library loads are adopted by the native
definition. Invalid placeholder values produce PostgreSQL's diagnostics.
Registration survives transaction rollback and `DROP EXTENSION`; dropping SQL
objects does not unload a library or unregister its settings.

Startup defaults retain PostgreSQL's source priority: configuration file,
database, role, database-and-role, then client connection options. A session
`SET` overrides the active value; `RESET` restores the strongest applicable default.
`pg_settings.source` and `reset_val` expose that distinction. Check hooks receive
the original source when a deferred definition adopts a startup placeholder,
including definitions loaded through `session_preload_libraries`.

Placeholder adoption also retains the original setter's identity and privilege
context. Loading a library as a superuser does not authorize another role's
earlier setting. PostgreSQL rechecks applicable parameter grants during adoption,
including separately saved `SET` and `SET LOCAL` states. A rejected replay warns
and preserves the preceding accepted value.

## Reserving a prefix

Declare a prefix at assembly scope to catch unknown settings after registration:

```csharp
[assembly: PgGucPrefix("my_extension")]
```

Ankus registers all declared settings first, checks the prefixes, then calls an
optional `[PgInitialize]` method. Prefix declarations also work in a library with
no settings or managed callbacks, including native-only shared preload.

On PostgreSQL 15 and later, PostgreSQL warns about and removes existing unknown
placeholders under the prefix, then rejects new placeholders with that first
component. Declared settings retain their adopted values. PostgreSQL 13 and 14
only warn; they retain the placeholders and allow new ones. Reservation survives
transaction rollback and repeated library loading.

Prefix matching is literal and case sensitive, even though setting lookup is
case insensitive. Use the same spelling consistently. Ankus passes the supplied
text without normalizing it: a dotted prefix can remove matching existing
placeholders but does not reserve a first component against future ones. Empty
prefixes retain native behavior. Null, embedded zero characters, and malformed
Unicode produce `ANKUS015`. Non-ASCII prefixes use the backend's database encoding;
shared-preload prefixes currently must be ASCII.

## Types and metadata

| Attribute | Property type | Additional metadata |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PgGucBool` | `bool` | Native Boolean spelling and synonyms |
| `PgGucInt` | `int` | Inclusive `Minimum` and `Maximum` |
| `PgGucReal` | `double` | Inclusive `Minimum` and `Maximum` |
| `PgGucString` | `string` or `string?` | Nullable boot value requires a nullable property |
| `PgGucEnum` | A C# enum | Optional `PgGucLabel` names and hidden labels |

Every declaration accepts a name, a constant default value, and a short
description. Optional properties include `LongDescription`, `Context`, `Flags`,
`Unit`, `Check`, `Assign`, and `Show`. Names must be qualified PostgreSQL parameter
names, such as `my_extension.limit`. Invalid declarations report `ANKUS014`.

Strings are owned managed copies. A null boot/reset string remains distinct from
an empty string in the typed getter, although ordinary `SHOW` displays both as
empty text. Nonnullable string properties require a nonnull default and cannot
accept a null result from a check hook.

GUC enums are independent of SQL catalog enums:

```csharp
public enum Mode : ulong
{
    [PgGucLabel("normal")]
    Normal = ulong.MaxValue,

    [PgGucLabel("experimental", Hidden = true)]
    Experimental = 1UL << 63,
}

public static partial class Settings
{
    [PgGucEnum("my_extension.mode", Mode.Normal, "Execution mode")]
    public static partial Mode Mode { get; }
}
```

Generated ordinal mappings preserve the managed enum's underlying values.
Aliases share an ordinal, and the first declared label is the canonical display
name. Native label matching is case insensitive. Hidden labels remain accepted
inputs but are omitted from available-value hints and `pg_settings.enumvals`.

`PgGucContext` expresses PostgreSQL's seven contexts: `Internal`, `Postmaster`,
`Sighup`, `SuperuserBackend`, `Backend`, `SuperuserSet`, and `UserSet`. Native
privilege checks remain authoritative, including parameter privileges where the
server supports them.

Combine `PgGucOptions` values through the attribute's `Flags` property. These
include listing/reset behavior, client reporting, restricted visibility,
identifier-sized strings, configuration-file restrictions, security restrictions,
and EXPLAIN settings. `RuntimeComputed` requires PostgreSQL 15 or later.
`PgGucUnit` separately selects one memory or time unit for numeric settings;
block conversions use the selected server's compiled block sizes.

Options map to the native flags rather than adding an independent policy. In
PostgreSQL 18, `DisallowInFile` blocks `ALTER SYSTEM` and affects configuration
help, but does not itself reject a custom `UserSet` parameter supplied manually
in a configuration file. Choose the appropriate context and check hook for
additional restrictions.

## Hooks

Name an accessible synchronous static hook in the property's containing class:

```csharp
public static partial class Settings
{
    [PgGucInt("my_extension.batch", 10, "Batch size", Check = nameof(CheckBatch))]
    public static partial int Batch { get; }

    internal static PgGucCheckResult<int> CheckBatch(int proposed, PgGucSource source)
    {
        if (proposed <= 0)
        {
            return new(new PgGucCheckError("Batch size must be positive."));
        }

        return new(proposed);
    }
}
```

For a property of type `T`, hook signatures are:

```csharp
PgGucCheckResult<T> Check(T proposed, PgGucSource source)
void Assign(T accepted, PgGucExtra? extra)
string Show(T current, PgGucExtra? extra)
```

A check result can accept a normalized value with optional `PgGucExtra`, or reject
it with `PgGucCheckError`. Native numeric bounds validate the proposed input;
PostgreSQL does not revalidate a numeric replacement accepted by the hook.
Extra data is an immutable copied byte sequence; null
and empty data are distinct. PostgreSQL retains a flat native allocation for the
accepted value and its reset/transaction history. Assign and show receive owned
managed copies which can outlive that native allocation.

Checks can run for boot defaults, file reloads, startup options, ordinary `SET`,
and validation-only operations such as `ALTER ROLE` or function `SET` clauses.
Validation does not guarantee assignment. A rejected result preserves native
severity selection: an interactive change can raise ERROR while placeholder
adoption can warn. A null diagnostic message keeps PostgreSQL's default message.
Thrown managed exceptions are contained and converted to native check diagnostics.

Assign runs before PostgreSQL changes the backing value. Reading the property in
assign returns the old value. Restoration calls assign with previously accepted
extra data without running check again. Assign hooks must not fail: an unexpected
exception terminates that backend with FATAL, since continuing could leave
partially restored state.

Show changes display text without changing typed storage or boot/reset metadata.
It must return a nonnull string. A show failure raises ERROR during a transaction;
outside a transaction, such as client parameter reporting, it terminates the
backend with FATAL.

Typed setting reads are available in every hook. Check hooks can use guarded SQL
when PostgreSQL has a valid transaction. Assign and show cannot use SQL, including
during ordinary `SET`, because PostgreSQL also calls them during restoration and
outside transactions. `PgLog` is available in every hook through a separate native
binding, including file reloads, rollback restoration, and client parameter
reporting. It preserves filtering, structured fields, and database encoding without
enabling SQL. Explicit `Fatal` and `Panic` reports retain their severity after
managed code unwinds. An unhandled `Error` follows the hook's failure policy:
check rejection, assign FATAL, or show ERROR/FATAL according to transaction state.

## Parallel queries

PostgreSQL restores configuration in each parallel worker. Managed state starts
independently in that process; check hooks run there to reconstruct extra data
from the propagated value and source. Do not treat managed static fields or
previously returned extra objects as shared state between workers.

Native PostgreSQL serialization preserves an untouched default null string by
leaving it at its default. A nondefault null string serializes as empty text, so
the worker's check hook receives an empty string. This distinction also applies
when a leader's check hook normalized a nonnull input to null.

Ordinary configuration changes are forbidden during a parallel operation.
PostgreSQL permits a function's declared `SET` clause and restores that worker's
previous value and extra data when the function returns. Mark a function
parallel safe only when its complete behavior meets PostgreSQL's requirements.

## Preloading

Settings can be registered through `shared_preload_libraries`, including settings
with managed hooks or `[PgInitialize]`. `Postmaster` settings require this loading
mode. A late load is rejected before PostgreSQL's fatal late-registration path.

The configuration sample has a startup-only setting:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'Ankus.Examples.Configuration'
ankus_configuration.startup = 11
```

Shared-preload names, descriptions, labels, and string defaults currently must be
ASCII: the postmaster has no database encoding to use for inherited metadata.
Backend registration supports server-encoded text. During postmaster startup,
managed hooks have no transaction, so `Spi` is unavailable. The same hooks can use
`Spi` later when PostgreSQL calls them inside a backend transaction.
