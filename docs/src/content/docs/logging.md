title: Logging and errors
description: Report PostgreSQL notices, structured diagnostics, and errors from C#.
---

`PgLog` sends messages through PostgreSQL's reporting system:

```csharp
PgLog.Notice("Refresh complete.");
```

Calls require the active PostgreSQL backend thread. `Console.WriteLine` does not
produce a PostgreSQL notice.

Configuration check, assign, and show hooks can log during reload, rollback, and
client parameter reporting, including outside transactions. Their logging binding
does not grant SQL access. See [configuration hooks](/configuration/#hooks) for
phase restrictions and the failure policy for an unhandled `Error`.

## Levels and filtering

`Debug5` through `Debug1` provide decreasing detail. `Log` reports operational
messages, and `ServerOnly` keeps them out of the client connection. `Info` always
reaches clients. `Notice` and `Warning` report events without stopping execution.

Each level has a named helper with literal-text and `PgDiagnostic` overloads:
`PgLog.Debug5` through `Debug1`, `Log`, `ServerOnly`, `Info`, `Notice`, `Warning`,
`Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic`. Use `PgLog.Write` when the severity is selected at
runtime. The helpers retain the same filtering, SQLSTATE and diagnostic fields.

Nonterminal message emission temporarily holds PostgreSQL interrupts. Pending
cancellation is processed at a later interrupt check, after the report finishes.
Call `PgInterrupts.Check()` periodically in loops that only log messages. Native
reporting errors, such as an encoding failure, still follow normal error recovery.

PostgreSQL applies `client_min_messages` and `log_min_messages` separately. In the
server log, `Log` ranks above `Error`; it is not an ordinary numeric threshold.

Check the current settings before doing expensive formatting:

```csharp
if (PgLog.IsEnabled(PgLogLevel.Debug1))
{
    PgLog.Debug1($"Prepared {items.Count} items.");
}
```

Messages are literal text. Percent signs have no special meaning.

## Structured messages

```csharp
PgLog.Warning(new PgDiagnostic("Entry has expired.")
{
    SqlState = PgSqlStates.Warning,
    Detail = "The entry was last refreshed yesterday.",
    Hint = "Refresh it before the next query.",
    TableName = "cached_entries",
});
```

`PgDiagnostic` also accepts context, object names, query positions, and source
locations. `DetailLog` replaces `Detail` in the server log and is never sent to
the client. Messages retain their full text across the native boundary.

Without an explicit SQLSTATE, warnings use `01000`, errors use `XX000`, and lower
levels use `00000`. An explicit code has five uppercase ASCII letters or digits;
error levels cannot use `00000`.

## Errors

`PgLog.Error(...)` throws `PgException`. Extension code can catch
it and continue. An unhandled exception becomes PostgreSQL `ERROR` after the
managed method and its `finally` blocks have finished.

`Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic` are marked as never returning normally, including
when a report fails validation. `PgLog.Write(PgLogLevel.Error, ...)` remains
available for code that chooses the severity at runtime.

Client drivers can apply their own connection policy. For example,
[Npgsql closes connections for SQLSTATE class XX](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/blob/v10.0.3/src/Npgsql/PostgresErrorCodes.cs#L432),
including the default `XX000`, even when PostgreSQL can recover from the `ERROR`.
For expected application errors, supply a condition-specific SQLSTATE such as
`PgSqlStates.InvalidParameterValue`.

Throwing `PgException` directly is also supported:

```csharp
throw new PgException(PgSqlStates.InvalidParameterValue, "Count must be positive.", hint: "Pass a count greater than zero.");
```

`PgSqlStates` provides named strings for every SQLSTATE in the PostgreSQL 13–18
and 19 beta source catalogs, including native aliases and retired names. Use
them directly with `PgException`, `PgDiagnostic.SqlState`, and exception filters:

```csharp
catch (PgException error) when (error.SqlState == PgSqlStates.UniqueViolation)
{
    PgLog.Write(PgLogLevel.Notice, "The entry already exists.");
}
```

Names distinguish conditions that share wording across classes, such as
`WarningStringDataRightTruncation` (`01004`) and `StringDataRightTruncation`
(`22001`). A constant does not imply that its server feature exists in every
version: for example, `TransactionTimeout` was added in PostgreSQL 17, while
`SnapshotTooOld` belongs to PostgreSQL 13–16. The API reference records version
differences. Custom codes remain ordinary strings and retain their exact value;
they do not need registration or a catalog entry.

PostgreSQL query cancellation throws `PgQueryCanceledException`, which derives
from `OperationCanceledException`. Its `Diagnostic` property retains SQLSTATE
`57014` and the original PostgreSQL error fields. Catching it allows managed
cleanup, but the query still fails at the native boundary. Further server work
is rejected until that boundary returns. This also applies inside
`PgTransaction.RunInSubtransaction` and recursive SQL calls.

Background workers have their own recovery boundaries. A canceled worker
transaction must roll back before continuing. Outside a transaction, a worker
can catch cancellation from `Wait` or `PgInterrupts.Check()` and continue after
that operation finishes. See [worker cancellation](/background-workers/#database-work-and-errors).

For long loops that stay in managed code, call `PgInterrupts.Check()` periodically:

```csharp
for (int index = 0; index < values.Length; index++)
{
    PgInterrupts.Check();
    Process(values[index]);
}
```

The check processes query cancellation, statement timeouts and backend shutdown
through PostgreSQL's native interrupt handler. It also dispatches queued signals
on Windows. With no pending work it reads native flags without a native call.
PostgreSQL interrupt holdoffs still apply. A retained cancellation remains pending
on subsequent checks even after a managed catch.

Call it on the active backend thread. A task or thread-pool continuation has no
backend capability. Release spinlock and shared-memory guards before polling.

`Fatal` and `Panic` also unwind managed code before reporting at the native
boundary. Their severity and diagnostics remain pending even if a
`catch (Exception)` block swallows the managed exception or a subtransaction
rolls back. `Fatal` ends the backend connection.
`Panic` aborts the backend and causes PostgreSQL to terminate peer backends and
perform crash recovery.
