title: Ankus for pgrx users
description: Translate pgrx declarations, values, ownership, and extension workflows into C#.
---

Ankus keeps PostgreSQL's extension model and expresses it through C# attributes,
compiler-checked interfaces and source generation. Publish an extension as a
Native AOT library with its SQL and control files. The server does not need a
separate .NET installation.

Execution options such as volatility, parallel safety and NULL policy are enum
properties on the attributes. SQL names can differ from C# names. Ankus generates
and orders support functions, types and dependent SQL during the build.

## SQL NULL and values

Rust's `Option<T>` becomes nullable C# value types or nullable reference
annotations. Enable nullable reference types in the extension project; oblivious
reference parameters are rejected rather than silently made strict.

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static string Greet(string? name) => $"Hello, {name ?? "world"}!";
```

The nullable parameter allows SQL NULL to reach this method. With inferred NULL
policy, an entirely required signature is `STRICT`. For mixed signatures, a NULL
required argument returns SQL NULL without invoking C#; nullable arguments are
passed through. A nullable result can return SQL NULL.

| pgrx value or concept | Ankus representation |
|---|---|
| `&str`, `String` | `string`; checked native borrowing through `PgTextView` |
| `Vec<u8>` / `bytea` | `byte[]`; `PgByteaView` for borrowed bytes |
| SQL arrays | `T[]` for vectors, `PgArray<T>` for explicit shape, `PgArrayView<T>` for checked borrowing |
| `Json`, `JsonB` | `PgJson`, `PgJsonb` |
| `AnyNumeric` | `PgNumeric` |
| PostgreSQL date/time values | `PgDate`, `PgTime`, `PgTimestamp`, `PgTimestampTz`, `PgTimeTz`, `PgInterval` |
| `AnyElement`, `AnyArray` | `PgAnyElement`, `PgAnyArray` |
| Native `Datum` | `PgDatum` with explicit `[PgSqlType]` where required |
| Composite tuples | `PgHeapTuple`, optionally bound with `[PgCompositeType]` |
| Managed aggregate payload | `PgAggregateState<T>` |
| Backend-owned opaque state | `PgInternal` |

Use the full-range PostgreSQL temporal types when .NET's built-in range cannot
represent a value. Use shaped arrays when dimensions or lower bounds matter.
Conversions reject unsupported or lossy representations; see the individual
value guides for exact rules.

## Ownership and backend access

Rust lifetimes become explicit ownership and checked lifetimes in Ankus's
wrappers. `PgMemoryContext`, owned allocations and borrowed views distinguish
who frees native storage and when access ends. A managed reference does not keep
a PostgreSQL buffer alive. Copy values into an appropriate owner before retaining
them beyond the current callback.

`using` and `Dispose` release owned resources deterministically. Dispose native
database resources on the backend thread. Managed GC, tasks and finalizers have
different rules from PostgreSQL memory contexts; read
[Running .NET inside PostgreSQL](/reference/execution/) before introducing
background work or large caches.

`pg_sys` calls correspond to generated `NativeMethods` and `NativeGlobals`, with
the native names preserved. Ankus guards PostgreSQL errors in native code before
they reach managed frames. The caller still owns native argument, layout,
allocator and lifetime correctness. Raw calls and global accesses require an
unsafe context, including signatures containing only scalars. Data pointers
retain their C# pointee types. See [native bindings](/raw-values/).

## SPI, errors and cancellation

Use `Spi.ExecuteScalar<T>`, `Spi.Execute` and `Spi.Connect` for backend SQL.
Parameters are explicit `SpiParameter` values. A connected session stays inside
its callback. Result rows are managed copies; kept plans and cursors have their
own lifetime rules. See [SPI queries](/spi/).

`Spi.Select`, `Spi.SelectRaw` and the default cursor overload follow
`SpiClient::select`: they use read-only snapshots until the transaction becomes
writable, then take fresh writable snapshots. Sessions and plans expose the
same selection methods. `Execute`, default `Query` overloads and scalar helpers
establish writable intent, matching pgrx's `run` and `get_one`. Use
`Spi.Query(sql, readOnly: true, limit: 0)` or the corresponding `SpiSession.Query`
overload for PostgreSQL's read-only snapshot and write restrictions. The
`Execute` and `ExecuteScalar` methods have no `readOnly` overload. A query
beginning with `SELECT` does not select read-only snapshot behavior.

Throw `PgException` to report a PostgreSQL SQLSTATE and owned diagnostic fields.
`PgLog` supplies PostgreSQL message levels. Native errors unwind managed cleanup
before PostgreSQL reports them at the outer boundary.

For deliberate error recovery comparable to a `PgTryBuilder` recovery scope,
use `PgTransaction.RunInSubtransaction` around work that must roll back. A plain
`catch (Exception)` cannot make an unrecovered raw native failure successful.
Cancellation, `Fatal` and `Panic` remain pending even after a catch or rollback.
See [recoverable work](/transaction-callbacks/#recoverable-work).

Use `PgInterrupts.Check()` where Rust code would use `check_for_interrupts!` in
a long loop. Call it on the PostgreSQL thread; thread-pool continuations do not
have backend access.

## Workers and configuration

`BackgroundWorkerBuilder` workflows use `PgBackgroundWorker` registration and a
`[PgBackgroundWorker]` entry point. Worker transactions, signals and latches
remain PostgreSQL operations. `PgLwLock<T>`, `PgAtomic<T>` and
`PgSharedMemory.Initialize` provide shared state with explicit native ownership.
See [background workers](/background-workers/) and [shared memory](/shared-memory/).

GUC declarations use attributes on static partial properties:

```csharp
public static partial class Settings
{
    [PgGucInt("my_extension.limit", 100, "Maximum items", Minimum = 1)]
    public static partial int Limit { get; }
}
```

Check, assign and show hooks are ordinary named methods selected by the
attribute. Their phase and SQL-access restrictions still apply. See
[configuration settings](/configuration/).

## Extension workflow

| cargo-pgrx workflow | Ankus workflow |
|---|---|
| Create an extension | `ankus new Hello` |
| Register or install PostgreSQL | `ankus init --pg18 download`, or supply `pg_config` |
| Run tests | `dotnet test`, or `ankus test --pg 18` |
| Run in-backend benchmarks | `ankus bench --pg 18` |
| Build and enter the development database | `ankus run --pg 18` |
| Connect without rebuilding | `ankus connect --pg 18` |
| Install or package the extension | `ankus install`, `ankus package` |
| Run SQL regression files | `ankus regress --pg 18` |

The project SDK selects the matching headers, generated bindings and packaged
Native AOT runtime. `AnkusPostgresMajor` selects the project's PostgreSQL major;
an explicit `--pg` selects a command invocation. See the [CLI guide](/reference/cli/)
for each command's supported options and version selection.

When migrating an existing extension, preserve SQL identity and review its
on-disk representation separately. Generated C# storage is not a promise of
binary compatibility with a Rust serializer. Use an explicit codec or SQL
upgrade path when existing data must remain readable. Shared-preload libraries
and runtime servicing also require the deployment steps in the
[publishing](/getting-started/publishing/) and [.NET support](/reference/dotnet-support/)
guides.
