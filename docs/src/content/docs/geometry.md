title: Geometric values
description: Use PostgreSQL points, lines, boxes, circles, paths, and polygons from C#.
---

Ankus maps PostgreSQL's built-in geometric types to double-precision C# values:

| C# | PostgreSQL | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PgPoint` | `point` | `X`, `Y` |
| `PgLine` | `line` | Coefficients `A`, `B`, `C` for Ax + By + C = 0 |
| `PgLineSegment` | `lseg` | Ordered `Start` and `End` points |
| `PgBox` | `box` | Normalized `High` and `Low` corners |
| `PgCircle` | `circle` | `Center` and `Radius` |
| `PgPath` | `path` | Owned vertices and `IsClosed` |
| `PgPolygon` | `polygon` | Owned vertices and `BoundingBox` |

The first five are immutable value types. Paths and polygons are sealed classes
that copy their input vertices and expose them through `IReadOnlyList<PgPoint>`
and a read-only `Points` span.

## Write a function

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static PgBox Bounds(PgPolygon polygon) => polygon.BoundingBox;

[PgFunction]
public static PgPath ClosePath(PgPath path) => path.WithClosed(true);
```

```sql
SELECT bounds('((3,-2),(4,5),(-7,1))'); -- (4,5),(-7,-2)
SELECT close_path('[(1,2),(3,4)]');    -- ((1,2),(3,4))
```

Coordinates cross the native boundary in binary form. Conversion retains signed
zero, infinities, and NaN coordinate bits without decimal formatting.

## Construct and inspect

Constructors, indexing, formatting, box normalization, and polygon bounds work
without a PostgreSQL backend:

```csharp
var point = new PgPoint(1.5, -2.5);
var segment = new PgLineSegment(point, new PgPoint(4, 7));
var circle = new PgCircle(point, 3);
var box = new PgBox(new PgPoint(1, 9), new PgPoint(7, -2));

var path = new PgPath([point, new PgPoint(4, 7)], isClosed: false);
var polygon = new PgPolygon([new(3, -2), new(4, 5), new(-7, 1)]);
PgPoint first = polygon[0];
int count = polygon.Count;
PgBox bounds = polygon.BoundingBox;
```

Boxes and polygon bounds use PostgreSQL floating-point ordering: NaN sorts above
infinity, and signed zeroes compare equal. Paths retain their vertex order and
closure flag. Polygons retain their vertex order as supplied.

Fixed-size values use .NET record equality. This is exact coordinate/coefficient
equality, with normal `double.Equals` behavior for NaN and signed zero. PostgreSQL
geometric predicates may use tolerances, compare areas, or identify scaled line
coefficients as equivalent. Use SQL through [SPI](/spi/) for those predicates.

## Parsing and validation

Each type has `Parse` and `TryParse` methods using PostgreSQL's text input routine
on the active backend:

```csharp
PgPoint point = PgPoint.Parse("(1.5,-2.5)");
PgLine line = PgLine.Parse("[(0,0),(1,1)]");
PgPath path = PgPath.Parse("[(1,2),(3,4)]");
```

`TryParse` returns false for malformed input and coordinate range errors.
Backend-access and operational errors propagate. `ToString()` uses invariant
coordinate formatting and works on detached values.

`PgLine` and `PgCircle` constructors retain the supplied coefficients and radius.
PostgreSQL validates them when converting to SQL: near-zero `A` and `B`
coefficients together are invalid, as is a negative radius. In particular,
`default(PgLine)` must be initialized before it is used as a SQL line. Conversion
errors cross the guarded native boundary before managed code can handle them.

Empty paths and polygons can be constructed and exchanged, matching pgrx's owned
geometries. An empty polygon has a zero bounding box. PostgreSQL's text parser
requires at least one point, so empty collection formatting is not a text-input
round trip.

## Arrays and SPI

All seven types support nullable signatures, arrays, queries, prepared
statements, sessions, cursors, and editable rows:

```csharp
PgPoint?[] points = Spi.ExecuteScalar<PgPoint?[]>(
    "SELECT ARRAY[point(1,2), NULL, point(3,4)]");

PgPolygon polygon = Spi.ExecuteScalar<PgPolygon>(
    "SELECT $1", SpiParameter.Create(new PgPolygon([new(1,2), new(3,4)])));
```

Use `PgArray<T>` to retain multidimensional shapes and nonstandard lower bounds.
Geometric arrays follow the same [array conversion rules](/arrays/) as other
scalar types. Returned paths and polygons remain valid after native storage,
result batches, or cursors are released.
