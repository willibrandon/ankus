title: .NET support
description: Choose a .NET version and keep the runtime embedded in your extension up to date.

Ankus targets .NET 10 LTS for its initial `0.1.0` release. That release is still
pending. .NET 11 support is planned; it is not yet validated or available as a
supported extension target.

## Version policy

Ankus plans to support both LTS and STS .NET releases, starting with .NET 10.
Each new major must pass Ankus's native runtime and PostgreSQL validation before
it is listed as supported. A successful managed build alone does not establish
extension compatibility.

Once declared supported, a .NET major will remain serviced in a supported Ankus
release line until that .NET major reaches Microsoft's end of support. Use the
latest servicing release of that Ankus line. Adding .NET 11 will not remove
.NET 10 support or require existing extensions to retarget immediately.

As checked on September 28, 2026, Microsoft's policy provides three years for
LTS releases and two years for STS releases, with current patches required.
.NET 10 support ends November 14, 2028. .NET 11 is currently at RC1, with general
availability expected in November 2026. Microsoft's RC1 go-live status does not
establish Ankus support. See the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
for current dates.

Ankus releases use their own version numbers independently of .NET. There is
no planned .NET Framework, .NET Standard extension target, or backport to .NET
8/9. Ankus's native runtime integration requires an explicitly supported modern
.NET target. This is Ankus's project support policy; Microsoft's support does
not cover Ankus's runtime modifications.

## SDK, target framework, and embedded runtime

These versions serve different purposes:

| Selection | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| .NET SDK in `global.json` | The build tools and C# compiler used by your project |
| `TargetFramework`, currently `net10.0` | The .NET API contract your extension compiles against |
| `Ankus.Sdk` package version | Matching Ankus packages and the selected Native AOT compiler/runtime payload |
| PostgreSQL major and runtime identifier | The server ABI, operating system, and architecture of the native library |

Generated projects select stable .NET 10 SDKs with `rollForward: latestFeature`
and `allowPrerelease: false`. A .NET 11 SDK can coexist for other projects without
changing that selection. Installing a newer SDK does not retarget your extension
or update its embedded runtime. See [.NET SDK selection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json).

SDK 11 RC1 targeting `net10.0` has passed the complete test suite against
PostgreSQL 18.6 on Linux x64, using the .NET 10 compiler and embedded runtime.
Cross-platform and final-release validation remain open, as does the separate
`net11.0` runtime target. Keep the generated stable SDK selection until that
acceptance is complete.

Keep `net10.0` until Ankus documents support for another target. Ankus will select
a matching runtime for each supported target; extension authors should not need
to build a runtime fork or override compiler internals. The command-line tool,
native binding helper, and managed test host also need their declared .NET runtime
on the development machine. The selected SDK's compiler uses that SDK's own
runtime requirements. Installing a newer SDK does not replace the .NET 10 runtime
required by Ankus's managed tools. PostgreSQL servers do not need a separately
installed .NET runtime.

## Runtime servicing and deployment

Ankus includes a patched Native AOT runtime for PostgreSQL process and preload
behavior. Its compiler and runtime payload are versioned together. Support for
.NET 11 requires adapting and validating that patch against .NET 11, rather than
reusing a .NET 10 runtime with a .NET 11 compiler.

Ankus also selects the matching framework-library patch. Projects targeting an
unsupported framework or overriding `RuntimeFrameworkVersion` to a different
patch fail before publication. Update Ankus packages to service the embedded
runtime; changing that property does not update Ankus's patched runtime.

Native AOT embeds runtime code into the published library. Updating .NET on a
server does not update an already published extension. See Microsoft's
[Native AOT deployment documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/).

When Ankus ships a runtime servicing update:

1. Update the pinned `Ankus.Sdk` and any explicitly referenced Ankus packages to
   the matching supported release, and update the build SDK as instructed by its
   release notes.
2. Restore and republish the extension for every deployed PostgreSQL major and
   operating system/architecture. Test the resulting artifacts.
3. Stop the PostgreSQL processes that loaded the old libraries before replacing
   them, then restart those processes. Shared-preload extensions require stopping
   and restarting PostgreSQL. Replacing a library on disk does not replace code
   already loaded into a backend.

A runtime patch update alone does not imply a SQL schema upgrade. Follow your
extension's upgrade instructions if its SQL or stored-data format also changes.
