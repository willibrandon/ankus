title: Date and time values
description: Use .NET date and time types or preserve PostgreSQL's full temporal range.
---

Use ordinary .NET types when their range fits your data:

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static DateOnly NextDay(DateOnly date) => date.AddDays(1);

[PgFunction]
public static DateTimeOffset AddHour(DateTimeOffset instant) => instant.AddHours(1);
```

| .NET type | PostgreSQL type | Conversion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DateOnly` | `date` | Finite dates in years 1–9999 |
| `TimeOnly` | `time` | Midnight through 23:59:59.999999 |
| `DateTime` | `timestamp` | Requires `Kind.Unspecified` |
| `DateTimeOffset` | `timestamptz` | Converts to UTC; reads have offset zero |
| `TimeSpan` | `interval` | Elapsed microseconds, with no calendar months or days |

PostgreSQL stores temporal values at microsecond precision. Ankus rejects .NET
values containing sub-microsecond ticks rather than silently rounding them.
Unrepresentable values throw; .NET minimum and maximum dates are never treated
as infinity sentinels.

`timestamptz` stores an instant, not its original offset or a time-zone name.
The session's `TimeZone` affects how PostgreSQL displays it. Use `DateTimeOffset`
for instants and `DateTime` for timezone-free wall-clock values.

## Full-range values

The Ankus value types preserve PostgreSQL's full range and special values:

| Type | Stored value |
| --- | --- |
| [`PgDate`](/api/ankus.pgdate/) | Signed days since 2000-01-01, including BC dates and infinities |
| [`PgTime`](/api/ankus.pgtime/) | Microseconds since midnight, including the distinct value 24:00:00 |
| [`PgTimeTz`](/api/ankus.pgtimetz/) | Local time and a fixed offset in seconds east of UTC |
| [`PgTimestamp`](/api/ankus.pgtimestamp/) | Microseconds since 2000-01-01 without a timezone, including infinities |
| [`PgTimestampTz`](/api/ankus.pgtimestamptz/) | Microseconds since 2000-01-01 UTC, including infinities |
| [`PgInterval`](/api/ankus.pginterval/) | Independent month, day, and microsecond components |

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static PgDate? KeepDate(PgDate? date) => date;

[PgFunction]
public static PgDate NoDeadline() => PgDate.PositiveInfinity;

[PgFunction]
public static PgTime ClosingTime() => PgTime.EndOfDay;
```

The default date and timestamp values are the PostgreSQL epoch, 2000-01-01.
The default time is midnight and the default interval is zero. Nullable wrappers
represent SQL NULL independently of these values and infinities.

Use `FromDateOnly`, `ToDateOnly`, and the corresponding conversion methods on
the other types for explicit .NET conversions. Their range, precision, and
timezone checks are the same as the generated function conversions.

### Raw values and calendar fields

The raw constructors validate PostgreSQL's finite range and preserve its infinity
sentinels. Use `PgDate.FromRawSaturating`, `PgTimestamp.FromRawSaturating`, or
`PgTimestampTz.FromRawSaturating` when an out-of-range encoding should instead
become the corresponding infinity. `IsPositiveInfinity` and `IsNegativeInfinity`
distinguish the two sentinels.

`PgTime.FromMicrosecondsWrapping` reduces a signed microsecond count modulo one
day. It accepts the complete `long` range; minus one becomes 23:59:59.999999, and
24 hours becomes midnight. This differs from the checked constructor, which
retains the distinct 24:00 value.

`PgTimeTz.FromRawWrapping` accepts PostgreSQL's raw pair: microseconds and seconds
**west** of UTC. It applies pgrx's Euclidean modulo rules to both fields, including
the offset modulo 57,600. For example, a raw west offset of -1 wraps to 57,599
seconds west, so the result's `OffsetSeconds` is -57,599. Use the ordinary
constructor with seconds **east** of UTC when constructing a meaningful signed
offset; it validates the offset without wrapping it.

Dates and timestamps expose `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, and `GetDateParts()`.
Negative years denote BC and there is no year zero. Times and timestamps expose
`Hour`, `Minute`, `Second`, `MicrosecondsWithinSecond`, `FractionalSecond`, and
`GetTimeParts()`:

```csharp
var time = new PgTime(45_296_123_456); // 12:34:56.123456
int second = time.Second; // 56
int fraction = time.MicrosecondsWithinSecond; // 123456
double seconds = time.FractionalSecond; // 56.123456
(int hour, int minute, int wholeSecond, int microseconds) = time.GetTimeParts();
```

The tuple's microseconds are within the second. PostgreSQL's
`EXTRACT(MICROSECONDS)` includes whole seconds: the same time yields 56,123,456
through `GetPart(PgDateTimePart.Microseconds)` or `Extract`. The explicitly named
fractional property avoids that ambiguity.

`PgDate.ToJulianDays`, `ToUnixEpochDays`, and `ToUnixTimeSeconds` return exact
finite epoch values across PostgreSQL's full date range. These methods and finite
calendar/clock accessors throw `InvalidOperationException` for infinity. Raw
storage properties still expose the sentinel, and `GetPart`/`Extract` retain SQL's
infinity and NULL behavior.

Date, time, fixed-offset time, and timezone-free timestamp fields work outside
PostgreSQL. `PgTimestampTz` fields require the backend because they follow the
session timezone at that instant. They use native extraction, including at
endpoints where conversion to a local `timestamp` would overflow. Diagnostic
`ToString()` remains usable outside the backend for every value, including
infinities.

## Calendar intervals

PostgreSQL keeps months, days, and elapsed time separate. A month has no fixed
duration, and a calendar day can be 23 or 25 hours across daylight-saving changes.

```csharp
var calendarDay = new PgInterval(months: 0, days: 1, microseconds: 0);
PgInterval elapsedDay = PgInterval.FromTimeSpan(TimeSpan.FromHours(24));
```

These can produce different timestamps when added to the same instant.
`ToTimeSpan()` therefore accepts only finite intervals whose month and day
components are zero. Mixed component signs are preserved. Equality, hashing and
ordering follow PostgreSQL's interval comparison, which treats a month as thirty
days. Read `Months`, `Days` and `Microseconds` to compare stored components.

`PgInterval` implements `IComparable<PgInterval>`, so `Array.Sort`, `OrderBy`,
`CompareTo` and the `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=` operators use PostgreSQL's interval
ordering outside the backend. Comparison treats months as thirty days and days
as twenty-four hours, uses wide arithmetic, and sorts negative and positive
infinity below and above every finite value. This is an ordering approximation,
not a calendar-aware elapsed duration. One month and thirty days are equal and
have the same managed hash while retaining their original components. Both
sorted and hashed collections therefore treat those values as equivalent.

Use `Add`, `Subtract`, or arithmetic operators for PostgreSQL calendar arithmetic:

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static PgTimestamp NextMonth(PgTimestamp value)
    => value + PgInterval.FromMonths(1);
```

January 31 becomes the last day of February. For `PgTimestampTz`, calendar months
and days use the session's timezone. Adding elapsed hours can give a different
result across a daylight-saving transition.

Subtracting two timestamps returns an elapsed interval. `Age` returns a symbolic
calendar difference with years and months. Intervals also support `Multiply`,
`Divide`, `Negate`, `JustifyDays`, `JustifyHours`, and `Justify`. Use
`CompareInPostgres` to perform an interval comparison in the current backend.

`PgInterval.Create` accepts years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and fractional
seconds. Named arguments make the calendar distinction explicit:

```csharp
PgInterval calendarDay = PgInterval.Create(days: 1);
PgInterval elapsedDay = PgInterval.FromHours(24);
```

Construction rejects overflowing month, day, and microsecond arithmetic on every
supported PostgreSQL version. This also applies on older servers whose native
`make_interval` can silently wrap. Fractional seconds keep PostgreSQL's native
microsecond rounding. A rejected construction raises `PgException` and leaves
the backend usable after normal error recovery.

`FromYears` through `FromMicroseconds` provide individual unit factories.
`FromMicroseconds` preserves the complete signed 64-bit value. `Sign`, `Abs` and
`ToComparisonMicroseconds` use PostgreSQL's thirty-day-month comparison
convention; they do not calculate elapsed time across a calendar. `Sign` compares
the combined duration with zero, so one month minus thirty days has sign zero.
`Abs` returns the interval unchanged when its sign is zero or positive and
otherwise negates every component together. One month minus thirty-one days
becomes minus one month plus thirty-one days, which compares as one day, and
equivalent intervals have equivalent absolute values. Negating a component equal
to its signed minimum value throws `OverflowException`.

`PgInterval.PositiveInfinity` and `NegativeInfinity` require PostgreSQL 17 or
later. Their finite component properties are zero; check `IsFinite` first.
On earlier servers, writing an infinite interval raises an unsupported-feature
error (`0A000`), while parsing infinity text reports invalid interval syntax
(`22007`). The all-maximum and all-minimum component triples remain finite on
those older servers. On PostgreSQL 17+, writing those triples as finite values
raises a range error rather than changing their meaning to infinity.

## Parsing and formatting

The six full-range types expose `Parse`, `TryParse`, and `ToPostgresString`:

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static PgDate? ReadDate(string text)
    => PgDate.TryParse(text, out PgDate date) ? date : null;
```

Parsing accepts PostgreSQL input syntax, including special values. `DateStyle`
controls ambiguous date input and date/timestamp output. `IntervalStyle` controls
interval output. `TryParse` returns `false` and a default out value for invalid
input after rolling back its input operation; backend-access and operational
errors still throw. These types also implement `IParsable<T>` with the same
rules, so generic code such as `T.Parse(text, null)` uses PostgreSQL input.

In transaction callbacks and parallel operations before PostgreSQL 17, native
input errors must propagate because independent rollback is unavailable. See
[error recovery](/reference/execution/#errors).

Dates, times, and timestamps also expose `ToIsoString`, using PostgreSQL's ISO JSON
representation independently of `DateStyle`. A `PgTimestampTz` is formatted in the
session's timezone, with its offset. `ToPostgresString` and these `ToIsoString`
methods are explicit server-formatting methods; the record struct's `ToString()`
remains a managed diagnostic representation.

`PgInterval.ToIsoString()` formats an ISO 8601 duration without a backend. It
produces the same text as PostgreSQL's `iso_8601` interval style, independently of
the session's `IntervalStyle`:

```csharp
new PgInterval(months: 14, days: -3, microseconds: -7_200_500_000).ToIsoString();
// P1Y2M-3DT-2H-0.5S
```

Years and months share the month component's sign. Hours, minutes, and seconds
share the microsecond component's sign. Zero is `PT0S`, and the PostgreSQL 17
infinities are `infinity` and `-infinity`. PostgreSQL interval input reads this
text with the same components under every `IntervalStyle`.

`PgTimestampTz.ToIsoString(zone)` formats an instant in an explicit timezone. Its
offset comes from that instant, including historical offsets and daylight-saving
transitions. `PgTimeTz.ToIsoString(zone)` uses current-date rules because a time
with offset has no stored date.

## Timezones and fields

```csharp
[PgFunction]
public static PgTimestampTz NewYorkTime(PgTimestamp local)
    => local.AtTimeZone("America/New_York");

[PgFunction]
public static PgTimestampTz NewYorkDay(PgTimestampTz instant)
    => instant.Truncate(PgDateTimePart.Day, "America/New_York");
```

`PgTimestamp.AtTimeZone` interprets a wall-clock time in the named zone.
`PgTimestampTz.AtTimeZone` returns the local wall-clock timestamp for an instant.
Both follow PostgreSQL's rules for ambiguous and nonexistent times. Explicit-zone
truncation leaves the session timezone unchanged. A `PgTimeTz` has no date, so its
named-zone conversion uses PostgreSQL's current-date rules for daylight saving.

The three `AtTimeZone` methods also accept `PgInterval` for a fixed offset.
PostgreSQL rejects month/day components and infinite offsets for finite inputs;
it truncates offset fractions to whole seconds. Positive offsets mean east of
UTC. For a timestamp without a zone, the offset interprets the local clock; for
an instant or fixed-offset time, it shifts the local clock. A `timetz` result
outside `PgTimeTz`'s supported offset range is rejected during managed conversion.

`PgTimestampTz.ToUtc()` returns its timezone-free UTC timestamp, preserving
infinities. `PgTimeTz.ToUtc()` returns a time after offset adjustment and wrapping
at midnight; 24:00+00 becomes 00:00. Both work outside the backend.

[`PgTimeZone.GetOffset`](/api/ankus.pgtimezone/) resolves names, abbreviations,
and PostgreSQL POSIX timezone specifications using the server's timezone data:

```csharp
TimeSpan currentOffset = PgTimeZone.GetOffset("America/New_York");
TimeSpan historicalOffset = PgTimeZone.GetOffset("America/New_York", instant);
```

The first overload resolves at transaction start, matching pgrx's timezone-offset
helper. The second resolves at the supplied finite instant, including historical
second offsets and daylight-saving changes. Fixed abbreviations keep their fixed
offset; dynamic abbreviations use PostgreSQL's abbreviation table. Neither changes
the session timezone. Offset lookup can resolve a POSIX offset beyond `PgTimeTz`'s
range, such as `UTC+20`; constructing a `PgTimeTz` with that zone rejects the
unrepresentable offset.

`GetPart(PgDateTimePart)` follows `date_part` semantics and returns `double?`.
Undefined fields of infinite values return null; unsupported fields raise
`PgException`. Floating-point extraction can lose precision for large values.
On PostgreSQL 13, date extraction uses the server's timestamp conversion and its
narrower range. `Truncate` supports timestamps and intervals.

Use `Extract(PgDateTimePart)` for a [`PgNumeric`](/numeric/) result. PostgreSQL 14+
extracts directly to numeric, retaining exact fractional seconds even for
timestamps near the server's range limit. PostgreSQL 13 converts its floating-point
extraction result, matching that version's precision limits.

`Create` constructs dates, times, and timestamps from fields with PostgreSQL's
validation and fractional-second rounding. Negative years denote BC; year zero
is invalid. Timestamp construction with a negative year requires PostgreSQL 14+;
PostgreSQL 13's timestamp constructors reject it with SQLSTATE `22008`. BC
timestamps can still be parsed or created from raw values on PostgreSQL 13.
`PgTimestampTz.Create` accepts an optional explicit zone; otherwise
it uses the session timezone. `PgTimeTz.Create` accepts an explicit offset in
seconds or uses the session's current-date offset.

`PgTimeTz.Create(hour, minute, second, zone)` attaches the named zone's offset at
transaction start while retaining the supplied clock fields, including 24:00.
To shift a session-local clock to an interval offset, use
`PgTimeTz.Create(hour, minute, second).AtTimeZone(offset)`.
`OffsetHours` and `OffsetMinutes` expose signed whole components, discarding
remaining seconds; `OffsetSeconds` retains the complete offset, including seconds.

`PgDate.AtTime` combines a date with a time or fixed-offset time. Timestamp `ToDate`,
`ToTime`, and `PgTimestampTz.ToTimeTz` conversions follow server rules; the time
conversions return null for infinity.

`PgTimestampTz.TransactionTimestamp`, `StatementTimestamp`, and `ClockTimestamp`
read the three PostgreSQL clocks. `FromUnixTimeSeconds` accepts fractional seconds.

`PgTimestampTz.TimeOfDay` returns PostgreSQL's owned `timeofday()` text, including
six fractional-second digits and the session timezone abbreviation. It reads the
live wall clock, so it can change within a statement or transaction.

`PgDate.CurrentDate`, `PgTime.GetLocalTime`, `PgTimeTz.GetCurrentTime`,
`PgTimestamp.GetLocalTimestamp`, and `PgTimestampTz.GetCurrentTimestamp` match
SQL's current/local expressions. The methods accept a precision from zero through
six fractional-second digits and use the current transaction's start time.

Times and timestamps also expose `Round(precision)`, following PostgreSQL's type
modifiers. Rounding can reach 24:00 or carry into the next day. A timestamp that
rounds outside the finite range raises a `PgException` range error.

Server parsing, formatting, arithmetic, extraction, and timezone methods require
the active backend thread inside an Ankus callback. To catch a native error
and continue with backend work, catch outside `PgTransaction.RunInSubtransaction`.
Stored-value access, exact .NET conversions,
and date/time/timestamp comparisons also work outside PostgreSQL. `CompareTo` and
relational operators preserve infinities and the distinct 24:00 time value.

## JSON serialization

The six full-range types have `System.Text.Json` converters, applied through
`[JsonConverter]` on each type; the converter classes, such as `PgDateConverter`,
live in `Ankus.Serialization`. Include your containing type in a source-generated
context and pass its metadata:

```csharp
public sealed record Appointment(PgTimestampTz StartsAt, PgInterval Duration);

[JsonSerializable(typeof(Appointment))]
internal partial class AppointmentJsonContext : JsonSerializerContext;

// Inside an extension callback:
PgJson json = PgJson.Serialize(appointment, AppointmentJsonContext.Default.Appointment);
```

Dates, times, and timestamps serialize as PostgreSQL ISO strings. Intervals
serialize as the ISO 8601 durations returned by `PgInterval.ToIsoString()`, so
their JSON does not depend on `IntervalStyle`. PostgreSQL's own
`to_json(interval)` follows the session's style instead. For example, the
interval `-1 day -02:00:00` is written as `P-1DT-2H`. Under `sql_standard`,
PostgreSQL would output `-1 2:00:00`, which another session reads as
`-1 days +02:00:00`.

BC dates, infinities, 24:00, and second-resolution offsets remain representable.
Nullable types serialize as JSON null. Interval JSON is written without a backend.
Ankus also reads its own finite ISO 8601 interval text without a backend,
restoring the identical month, day, and microsecond components. Other temporal
JSON reading and writing requires the backend thread, and parsing follows the
same rules as `Parse`. Backend parsing also handles other interval spellings,
such as session-style text written by earlier Ankus versions, infinity, and the
all-maximum and all-minimum component triples that PostgreSQL 17 reads as
infinity. Invalid values throw `JsonException` with the property path and the
underlying `PgException` when PostgreSQL rejected the input.

PostgreSQL 13 and 14 cannot output a time component beyond the signed 32-bit
hour range, and their ISO 8601 input rejects such hour fields. Ankus JSON still
round-trips those intervals, but casting their JSON text to `interval` in SQL
fails on those servers.

## SPI

All temporal types work as typed parameters and results, including prepared
plans, sessions, cursors, and local row edits:

```csharp
PgDate date = Spi.ExecuteScalar<PgDate>("SELECT date 'infinity'");
DateOnly next = Spi.ExecuteScalar<DateOnly>(
    "SELECT $1 + 1", SpiParameter.Create(new DateOnly(2026, 9, 22)));
```

Untyped row cells contain the full-range `Pg*` value. `row.Get<DateOnly>(ordinal)`
and the other .NET readers perform checked conversions from that value.

## Datetime sample

The [datetime sample](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/tree/main/samples/Ankus.Examples.DateTime)
ports pgrx's interval arithmetic, ISO formatting, timezone conversion, bounded
random values and transaction, statement and wall-clock reads.

```sql
SELECT public.add_interval(date '2000-01-31', interval '1 month');
SELECT public.compose_timestamp(date '2000-12-31', time '24:00');
SELECT public.to_iso_string(now(), 'Asia/Kathmandu');
SELECT * FROM public.all_times();
```

These queries assume installation in `public`; use the schema where you installed
`ankus_datetime`. Arithmetic overloads preserve PostgreSQL's full range, exact
microseconds and calendar rules. `set_timezone` interprets its timestamp in the
current session timezone before projecting the instant into the named destination.
The session-dependent ISO, timestamp-with-time-zone arithmetic and timezone
conversion functions are stable, so cached queries see session timezone changes.
The other arithmetic and explicit-zone ISO overload are immutable.
