# pgrx tooling and compile-time test mapping

This maps the pgrx 0.19.3 test corpora below to the Ankus tests that verify the
same behavior, or records why a case does not apply. With the
[unit-test mapping](pgrx-test-mapping.md), it covers the corpora listed in the
[parity requirements](parity-requirements.md) except the inline unit tests.

- `pgrx-unit-tests/tests/`: `compile-fail/`, `todo/`, `nightly/` and `ui.rs`
- `pgrx-tests/src/`: `framework.rs`, `framework/shutdown.rs` and `proptest.rs`
- `pgrx-bench/src/` and `cargo-pgrx/src/command/bench.rs`
- `cargo-pgrx/tests/*.rs` and `cargo-pgrx/tests/fixtures/`

A case is a pgrx test file or test function, or a named framework or command
function or option; a row that lists several counts each. The audit covers 203
cases, read against Ankus at revision **10c1391** with the working tree of
2026-10-09: 36 compile-time cases, 57 testing-framework cases, 87 benchmark
cases and 23 `cargo-pgrx/tests` cases, in 118 rows. By row, 82 are Covered,
12 Different and 24 Rust-specific. Only the same behavior and edge cases count
as covered.

Paths are relative to the repository: **IT** is `tests/Ankus.IntegrationTests/`,
**RT** is `tests/Ankus.Runtime.Tests/`, **GT** is `tests/Ankus.Generators.Tests/`,
**BT** is `tests/Ankus.Build.Tests/` and **PT** is `tests/Ankus.PgConfig.Tests/`.
As in the unit-test mapping, a test is named by its file and method. Guides are
under `docs/src/content/docs/`.

Statuses: **Covered**, **Partial** (what is missing is named), **Gap** (no Ankus
test; the row says whether the feature exists), **Different** (a deliberate
behavior difference, with the guide that documents it) and **Rust-specific** (no
.NET analogue; the replacing .NET guarantee and its test are named).

## Summary

Ankus rejects the same invalid signatures with generator diagnostics. pgrx's
lifetime cases are borrow-checker errors; Ankus replaces them with checked native
lifetimes, where an expired view or handle throws instead of reading freed
memory, and with managed copies. Most of pgrx's `todo` cases, which pgrx expects
not to compile, compile and run in Ankus. The test fixture matches pgrx's cluster
lifecycle, per-test rollback, exact expected-error contract, `CASCADE` extension
creation, Valgrind support and property runner. The benchmark runner matches
pgrx's measurement, statistics, comparison summaries, history report, run
metadata and options, and adds the throughput output pgrx cannot reach.

## Compile-time cases

### compile-fail/

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aggregate-functions-dont-run-forever.rs | Rust-specific | pgrx rejects composite aggregate arguments and states that would outlive the call. Ankus passes them as owned `PgHeapTuple` values and keeps state in the aggregate context until reset: IT CompositesExampleTests CompositesSampleSumsScritches; IT AggregateTests ManagedStateLivesUntilResetAndReleasesExactlyOnce, AggregateSupportFunctionsRequireNativeAggregateContext; RT PgAggregateTests ReleaseInvalidatesBeforeCleanupAndRestoresScopes |
| array-as-non-mutable-args.rs | Covered | GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests ConcreteBorrowedArraysRejectReferencePassing: `ref`, `out`, `in` and `ref readonly` array arguments are ANKUS038 at the modifier |
| arrays-dont-leak.rs | Rust-specific | Borrowed views expire with their owner and copies survive: IT LargeArrayLifetimeTests LargeArrayPrefixBorrowsExpireAndCopiesSurvive (pgrx's 10,000-string array and five borrows, every owner-ending path); IT BorrowedArrayTests BorrowedArrayOwnersInvalidateEscapedViews; a returned borrowed array transfers its storage: IT BorrowedArrayCallbackTests BorrowedArrayReturnsSurviveCallbackCleanup |
| eq-for-postgres_hash.rs | Covered | GT CustomOperatorGeneratorTests InvalidCustomOperatorContractsAreDiagnosed: `[PgHashing]` without `[PgEquality]` is ANKUS418 and a hash method without the `IPgHashable` contract is ANKUS417; mapped types: GT MappedOperatorGeneratorTests InvalidMappedOperatorContractsAreDiagnosed |
| total-eq-for-postgres_eq.rs | Covered | GT CustomOperatorGeneratorTests InvalidCustomOperatorContractsAreDiagnosed: `[PgEquality]` without `IEquatable<T>` for the type itself, including a lookalike `IEquatable<int>`, is ANKUS415 |
| total-ord-for-postgres_ord.rs | Covered | Same test: `[PgOrdering]` without `IComparable<T>`, including a lookalike `IComparable<int>`, is ANKUS416, and ordering without equality is ANKUS418 |
| escaping-spiclient-1209-cursor.rs | Rust-specific | SPI rows are owned copies and a cursor cannot outlive its portal: IT SpiQueryTests MaterializedRowsSurviveSubsequentSpiCalls; IT SpiExampleTests SpiSampleDetachesCatalogAndCursorResults (`issue1209_fixed` repeated without leaking portals); IT SpiCursorTests TransactionEndInvalidatesCursor, ReusedPortalNameDoesNotReviveStaleCursor |
| escaping-spiclient-1209-prep-stmt.rs | Rust-specific | A plan borrowed from an SPI session fails after the session ends unless kept: IT SpiSessionTests ExpiredSessionOwnershipIsRejected, KeptSessionPlanSurvivesTransactionEnd; IT SpiPreparedTests DisposedPlanCannotBeExecutedOrFreedTwice |
| heap-tuples-dont-leak.rs | Rust-specific | Tuple cells are read as owned values and tuples own their slots: RT PgHeapTupleTests TupleAndCloneOwnTheirCellSlots, NestedValuesRemainOwnedAfterNativeTransportRelease; IT CompositeDatumTests StoredCompositeValuesSurviveSourceDeletion |
| invalid_pgcast_options.rs, too_many_cast_options.rs | Rust-specific | `[PgCast]` takes one typed `PgCastContext` argument, so an unknown option or a second context is a C# compile error. An undefined context value is ANKUS074: GT OperatorCastDiagnosticsTests OperatorAndCastErrorsIdentifyTheirAuthoredContract; GT PgOperatorCastGenerationTests InvalidCastSignaturesAreDiagnosed |
| no-arrays-of-arrays.rs | Covered | Nested arrays are ANKUS039 as results and ANKUS040 as arguments: GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests UnsupportedSignaturesAreRejected; nested borrowed views: GT TypedBorrowedArrayGeneratorTests TypedBorrowedArraysRejectUnsupportedElements. `PgFlatArray<T>` requires an unmanaged element, so a flat array of flat arrays does not compile |
| no-static-memcx.rs | Rust-specific | An injected `PgMemoryContext` is a checked handle that fails once its context ends: RT PgMemoryContextTests StaleContextCannotAllocateAndReportsNotAlive; IT MemoryContextTests SavedHandlesSurviveCallbacksAndExpireAtTransactionEnd |
| postgres-strings-arent-immortal.rs | Rust-specific | `string` arguments are managed copies. Borrowed `PgTextView` arguments expire at callback exit, and set results built from them keep their inputs: IT BorrowedBufferCallbackTests BorrowedBufferCallbacksExpireAliasesAndRecover; IT BorrowedBufferTests BorrowedBufferSetsRetainTheirInputs |
| table-iterators-arent-immortal.rs | Rust-specific | TABLE and set results with borrowed columns keep their own snapshots: IT BorrowedBufferResultTests BorrowedBufferTablesReleaseTheirSnapshots; IT CStringResultTests CStringSetResultsPreserveEachRowAndReleaseOwners |
| sql-translatable-invalid-pg-extern-positions.rs: bad_bare_u8 | Covered | GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests UnsupportedSignaturesAreRejected: a bare `byte` argument is ANKUS040 and result ANKUS039; `PgArray<byte>` is ANKUS039 |
| sql-translatable-invalid-pg-extern-positions.rs: bad_unit_arg, bad_result_arg | Rust-specific | C# has no unit-typed parameter or `Result` type; any other unmapped argument type is ANKUS040 at the parameter: GT FunctionSignatureTests FunctionSignaturesHavePreciseDiagnostics |
| sql-translatable-invalid-pg-extern-positions.rs: bad_setof_arg | Covered | GT PgSetGenerationTests SetSupportRetainsOrdinaryFunctionRestrictions: an `IEnumerable<int>` argument is ANKUS040 |
| sql-translatable-invalid-pg-extern-positions.rs: bad_table_arg | Covered | GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests UnsupportedSignaturesAreRejected: a sequence of tuples, the TABLE shape, as an argument is ANKUS040 |
| type-ident-manual-impl-must-define-key.rs | Rust-specific | A mapping's identity is the compiler's type symbol, not a hand-written key: GT ManagedTypeIdentityTests ManagedProviderKeysPreserveCompilerEquality; an unregistered managed provider is ANKUS382: GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests SqlTypeProviderManagedSelectionRequiresRegistration |
| type-ident-non-sql-leaf-types.rs | Covered | An unmapped TABLE column is ANKUS397 (GT PgSetGenerationTests InvalidSetRowShapesAndNamesAreDiagnosed, `(int Id, System.Uri Address)`); an unmapped argument is ANKUS040 (GT FunctionSignatureTests FunctionSignaturesHavePreciseDiagnostics); a nullable unmapped struct argument and result are ANKUS040 and ANKUS039 (GT PgFunctionGeneratorTests UnsupportedSignaturesAreRejected). `Result` is Rust-specific |
| u32.rs | Different | `uint` maps to `oid`, as the type table in `getting-started/functions.md` documents: IT DatumConversionTests ScalarValuesPreservePostgresRepresentation round-trips `0` and `4294967295` |
| variadic-is-dead.rs | Rust-specific | `params` is a parameter modifier, so a variadic result cannot be written. A `params` parameter must map to a SQL array (ANKUS041, GT FunctionSignatureTests FunctionSignaturesHavePreciseDiagnostics), and operators and casts reject one (ANKUS067, GT OperatorCastDiagnosticsTests OperatorAndCastErrorsIdentifyTheirAuthoredContract) |
| spi-prepare-prepared-statement.rs.ignored | Rust-specific | pgrx does not run this case. `Spi.Prepare` accepts SQL text, so preparing a prepared statement is a C# type error; no Ankus test |

### todo/

pgrx expects these cases to fail to compile until it supports them.

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| array-as-pbox.rs | Rust-specific | `PBox` has no counterpart. Array arguments are borrowed `PgArrayView<T>` values (IT TypedArrayCallbackTests GeneratedTypedArraysPreserveDeclaredResults), and `PgMemoryContext.CreateFlatArray<T>` builds a context-owned flat array (IT TypedArrayCallbackTests FlatArraysBuildInPlaceAndReturn) |
| busted-exotic-signature.rs | Covered | IT CompositeDatumTests CompositeDefaultsVariadicsAndCastsExecute: a defaulted nullable array of nullable composites, a TABLE column holding an array of composites, composite defaults and defaulted variadic composites; TableColumnsCarryTheirIndividualCompositeTypes; GT PgCompositeGenerationTests CompositeVariadicsAndDefaultsKeepBindings |
| composite-types-broken-on-spi.rs, vec-option-composite_type-nesting-problems.rs | Covered | Composite vectors and arrays with NULL rows are accepted and returned (IT CompositeDatumTests CompositeVectorInputsRetainNullRowsAndValues; IT TypedArrayCallbackTests GeneratedTypedArraysPreserveDeclaredResults), and a non-variadic composite array has a SQL default (IT CompositeDatumTests CompositeDefaultsVariadicsAndCastsExecute) |
| for-dog-in-dogs.rs | Covered | IT CompositeDatumTests CompositeDefaultsVariadicsAndCastsExecute: variadic composites with NULL rows, a defaulted variadic and a defaulted non-variadic composite array, as in `sum_scritches_for_names_array_default`; CompositeVectorInputsRetainNullRowsAndValues |
| random-vec-strs-arent-okay.rs | Covered | Text arrays with NULL cells arrive as `string?[]` or as borrowed `PgArrayView<PgTextView?>` (IT TypedArrayCallbackTests GeneratedTypedArraysPreserveDeclaredResults), and a text array parameter with an empty-array SQL default runs omitted and supplied (IT FunctionDeclarationTests SqlDispatchHonorsDeclarations) |
| roundtrip-tests.rs | Covered | Text and bytea arrays with NULL and empty cells round-trip through borrowed views: IT TypedArrayCallbackTests GeneratedTypedArraysPreserveDeclaredResults; cstring arrays: IT CStringTests CStringArraysPreserveShapeAndCellBytes |

### nightly/ and ui.rs

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nightly/compile-fail/allocation-doesnt-outlive-memcx.rs | Rust-specific | Rust's `allocator_api` has no counterpart. Managed collections live on the garbage-collected heap, and native allocations expire with their context: IT MemoryAllocationTests TransientContextsRestoreAndDeleteAcrossActionNativeAndCleanupFailures; RT PgAllocationTests ContextUsesNativeOwnerAndRejectsStaleIdentity |
| ui.rs: compile_fail, todo and the nightly compile_fail | Rust-specific | trybuild compares compiler output with `.stderr` files. Generator tests compile sources in memory, assert the diagnostic ID, severity, span and message, then check that the repaired source works: GT FunctionSignatureTests FunctionSignaturesHavePreciseDiagnostics |

## Testing framework

### Running a test (framework.rs)

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| run_test: one transaction per test, rolled back after success | Covered | IT PostgresTestClusterTests BackendFunctionWritesAreRolledBack; IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback (rollback checked after success, an expected error and each failure). Ankus also rolls back after a host failure or cancellation: IT PostgresTestClusterTests FailedCallbackRollsBackWrites, CanceledCallbackRollsBackWrites |
| run_test: the expected error matches the primary message exactly | Covered | IT PostgresTestClusterTests ExpectedErrorMatchesAndClusterRemainsUsable; IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback (non-ASCII and quoted messages pass, a different message fails) |
| run_test: an expected error that is not raised fails | Covered | IT PostgresTestClusterTests MissingExpectedErrorFailsAndRollsBack |
| run_test failure report, query_wrapper: SQLSTATE, message, location, detail, hint, schema and table | Covered | `PostgresTestException` wraps the server's `PostgresException`: IT PostgresTestClusterTests WrongExpectedErrorIncludesServerDiagnostics. Its file, line, routine, context, detail, hint, schema and table reach the client: IT PgDiagnosticTests NativeObjectDiagnosticsSurviveCatchAndRethrow, ManagedDiagnosticsReachClientWithoutTruncation, ConstraintViolationPreservesCatalogMetadata |
| format_loglines, get_named_capture: session and server log lines in the failure report | Covered | The exception carries the failing session's log lines, matched by application name (IT PostgresTestClusterTests WrongExpectedErrorIncludesServerDiagnostics; IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback), and the postmaster's report about the session's backend with its details when the backend died (IT PostgresTestClusterTests FailedTestReportsItsBackendsTermination) |
| `PGRX_TEST_SKIP` | Different | The host framework reports skips through `[PgTest(IgnoreReason = ...)]` and test filters, and missing prerequisites fail rather than skip (`getting-started/testing.md`). IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback reports an ignored case as not executed and rejects running it directly |
| client() | Covered | `PostgresTestCluster.OpenConnectionAsync`: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback; a disposed cluster refuses connections: IT PostgresTestClusterTests DisposeStopsOwnedClusterAndPreservesLogs |

### Setup and installation (framework.rs)

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get_test_framework, initialize_test_framework, dropdb: one setup per test binary, then initdb, start and database creation | Covered | The fixture starts once per test class and its cases share it: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback; IT ToolCommandTests TestingPackageRunsInIndependentMSTestProject, NewSolutionRunsManagedAndBackendTests. A failed setup fails every case and cleans up: IT ToolCommandTests NewSolutionReportsInitializationFailuresAndCleansUp. Each fixture gets a fresh cluster, so there is no database to drop |
| create_extension: `CREATE EXTENSION name CASCADE` | Covered | IT ExtensionDependencyTests FixtureInstallsRequiredExtensionsWithCascade: an extension whose control file requires another starts in the fixture, which creates the dependency first |
| get_extension_name | Covered | The name comes from the published control file, including a custom control file with a fixed schema: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback |
| install_extension: `cargo pgrx install --test` with features, profile, `--no-schema` and manifest path | Covered | The fixture publishes with `AnkusIncludeTests=true`, `Configuration`, `BuildProperties` and `ReuseSchema`: IT ToolCommandBackendTests BackendTestFixtureRejectsInvalidOptions; forwarded properties and configuration reach it: IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandRunsSelectedBackendTests, TestCommandRejectsForwardedConfiguration; schema reuse: IT ToolCommandSchemaReuseTests TestCommandSchemaReusePreservesSqlAndRebuildsBodies |
| get_cargo_test_features, get_cargo_args: read `cargo test` arguments from the process tree | Rust-specific | The testing package carries the build's properties into the test host: IT PostgresTestSelectionTests TestHostSelectionTracksBuildProperties |
| install_extension with `--sudo` under `CARGO_PGRX_TEST_RUNAS` | Different | The fixture never writes into the PostgreSQL installation (`reference/cli.md`, `--runas`). PostgreSQL 18 uses `extension_control_path` and older majors a private copy: IT PostgresTestInstallationTests ScriptDirectoriesStayInsideOwnedTestInstallation, DirectoryAliasStagesRunnableServerAndPreservesSource; IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandRunsSelectedBackendTests (`runas`) |
| PortReservation, get_pg_config: hold a free port until the server starts | Covered | IT ClusterPortHandoffTests PortCollisionRetriesAndPreservesCompetingListener, RepeatedPortCollisionsAreBoundedAndCleanEveryAttempt, CancellationAtHandoffDoesNotStartOrRetryPostgres; explicit ports: RequestedTestPortRunsQueriesAndIsReleased, OccupiedRequestedPortCleansUpWithoutSwitchingPorts; port bases: IT ToolCommandPortTests InitPersistsPortBasesAndPreservesUnselectedSettings |
| maybe_make_pgdata, make_socket_dir, sudo_command | Covered | IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClusterRunsAsAnotherAccount (the other account creates and owns the data, socket and log), FailedStartupCleansDataAndRetainsDiagnostic |
| initdb: C locale flags | Covered | `initdb` gets pgrx's locale for each platform; IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClustersSkipFsyncUnlessConfigured asserts the database's collation and character classes: `C` on Windows, `C` with `UTF-8` on macOS, and `C.UTF-8` on Linux where `locale -a` lists it |
| modify_postgresql_conf, postgresql_conf_contents; test pgrx_postgresql_conf_defaults_precede_extension_options | Different | Test clusters use pgrx's `log_min_messages = info` and `log_min_duration_statement = 1000`, a C collation and UTF-8, and supplied settings follow and override them: IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClustersSkipFsyncUnlessConfigured; supplied settings reach the server: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback. Unlike pgrx, they do not set `log_statement = 'all'`; `getting-started/testing.md` documents this and how to enable it |

### Server lifecycle (framework.rs)

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| start_pg: `pg_ctl start`, readiness and the startup failure report | Covered | Startup waits through `pg_ctl -w` within a bounded timeout; a failed start reports and keeps the log: IT PostgresTestClusterTests FailedStartupCleansDataAndRetainsDiagnostic; IT PostgresEventLogTests EventDiagnosticsPreserveStartupFailureAndCleanup |
| pipe::UnixFifo, pipe::WindowsNamedPipe | Rust-specific | The server logs to a file, and on Windows the fixture also collects the cluster's Event Log messages: IT PostgresEventLogTests EventDiagnosticsRemainIsolatedAndSurviveShutdown |
| start_pg: live echo of `TMSG:` log lines | Different | Messages a test raises that contain `TMSG: ` are written to that test's output as they arrive: IT PostgresTestClusterTests TestMessagesAreEchoedWhileTheTestRuns. Ankus reads them from the session's INFO, NOTICE and WARNING messages rather than the server log, so MSTest attributes each one to its test and run-as servers need no log reads; `LOG`-level lines and other processes' lines stay in the server log, which failure reports include (`getting-started/testing.md`) |
| use_valgrind, valgrind_suppressions_path | Covered | `start`, `run`, `connect`, `regress`, `bench` and test clusters run the server under Valgrind with pgrx's Memcheck options (IT ToolCommandValgrindTests ValgrindCommandsExecuteNativeExtensionAndPreserveData; IT PostgresValgrindTests ValgrindReportsNativeErrorsAndPreservesDiagnostics, TestClustersRunUnderValgrind); `ankus test --valgrind` and `ANKUS_TEST_VALGRIND` select it for every fixture. PostgreSQL's `valgrind.supp` comes from the PGXS tree, where `ankus init` installs it because it removes its source tree, or from the source tree PGXS records: IT PostgresValgrindTests ValgrindUsesPostgresSuppressions suppresses the probe's report |
| start_pg: pass `CARGO*` and `RUST*` variables through `sudo` | Rust-specific | Backend tests do not need Cargo's environment; a server run as another account through `sudo` starts and serves queries: IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClusterRunsAsAnotherAccount |
| start_pg shutdown hook: `pg_ctl stop -m fast` at exit, then remove data and sockets | Covered | Disposal stops the server and removes data and sockets, keeping logs: IT PostgresTestClusterTests DisposeStopsOwnedClusterAndPreservesLogs; a timed-out stop can be retried: IT PostgresShutdownRecoveryTests CanceledShutdownCanReclaimStoppedClusterOnRetry; `ankus test` cleans up after a killed or canceled host: IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandPreservesRunnerExitAndCleansAbandonedCluster, TestCommandCancellationStopsCluster; a host that exits without disposing its cluster removes it through the `ProcessExit` handler: IT ToolCommandPortTests PackagedExtensionFixtureUsesSavedTestPortAndCleansUp |
| wait_for_pidfile, get_pid_file | Different | Each cluster's data directory has a unique name, so no earlier server can hold it (`getting-started/testing.md`): IT PostgresTestClusterTests DisposeStopsOwnedClusterAndPreservesLogs |

### Paths, accounts and tools (framework.rs)

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get_pgdata_path, test_invocation_dir_name; test test_pgdata_path_preserves_per_invocation_suffix | Covered | IT ToolCommandTestStorageTests PackagedExtensionFixtureUsesCustomDataDirectory, TestCommandRejectsInvalidDataDirectory; IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandRunsSelectedBackendTests (`custom-data`: data beneath the chosen base, removed afterward, other contents kept) |
| get_socket_dir_path, default_socket_dir_base; test test_socket_dir_is_separate_from_pgdata_parent | Covered | IT PostgresTestClusterTests SocketRootFitsThePlatformLimit, ClusterRunsAsAnotherAccount (socket under `/tmp`, apart from the data) |
| test test_socket_dir_defaults_under_tmp_on_unix | Different | On Linux, sockets stay in the temporary directory when the path fits the socket limit and use `/tmp` otherwise; macOS and another account always use `/tmp` (`reference/cli.md`, `--pgdata`): IT PostgresTestClusterTests SocketRootFitsThePlatformLimit |
| get_pg_dbname, get_pg_user | Different | Fixtures connect to `ankus_tests` as the cluster's own superuser, independent of the operating system account and `--runas` (`reference/cli.md`, `--runas`); `DatabaseName` and `UserName` select others: IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClusterRunsAsAnotherAccount |
| get_runas, requires_runas | Covered | `ankus test --runas`: IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandRunsSelectedBackendTests (`runas`); IT PostgresTestClusterTests ClusterRunsAsAnotherAccount |
| cargo_pgrx, workspace_cargo_pgrx, find_on_path; tests cargo_pgrx_prefers_explicit_override, workspace_cargo_pgrx_runs_from_source_even_with_a_target_binary | Rust-specific | The fixture runs `dotnet publish` from the host's SDK, so there is no separate tool to locate: IT ToolCommandTests TestingPackageRunsInIndependentMSTestProject |

### shutdown.rs, proptest.rs and concurrency

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| add_shutdown_hook, run_shutdown_hooks | Different | Test hosts release resources in class or assembly cleanup through `IAsyncDisposable` (`getting-started/testing.md`); the generated fixture disposes in `[ClassCleanup]`: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback |
| PgTestRunner::run | Covered | `PgPropertyRunner` runs each input in a subtransaction, reports a backend error as a failing input and shrinks it: RT PgPropertyRunnerTests (shrinking to boundaries, text, arrays and special values, seeds, sign-and-magnitude integers, valid text, rejections, cancellation and limits, input formatting); IT PropertyRunnerTests BackendErrorsAreFailingInputs (division by zero shrinks to 0, failing inputs roll back, passing inputs keep their rows, the session continues). pgrx-unit-tests' eight `proptests` run as IT PropertyRunnerTests TemporalValuesRoundTripForGeneratedInputs. Ankus has its own generators rather than proptest's, because .NET has no Microsoft-owned property-testing package; shrinking edits the recorded random choices, as Hypothesis does |
| Concurrent execution: one setup under `TEST_MUTEX`, separate sessions, a port and data directory per invocation | Covered | Clusters in one process have separate ports and data: IT PostgresTestClusterTests DisposeStopsOwnedClusterAndPreservesLogs; another live cluster under the same base is unaffected: IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandPreservesRunnerExitAndCleansAbandonedCluster; two concurrent `RunInTransactionAsync` callbacks use separate backends, cannot see each other's uncommitted rows and both roll back: IT PostgresTestClusterTests ConcurrentCallbacksAreIsolatedAndRolledBack |

## Benchmarks

### pgrx-bench/src/

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bencher::iter, Bencher::iter_batched: one timing loop per benchmark | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests BencherRequiresExactlyOneRoutine, BatchedSetupRunsImmediatelyBeforeMeasuredRoutine, BatchedMeasurementIncludesInputPreparation |
| black_box | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests BlackBoxDoesNotBoxValueTypes |
| BatchSize, iterations_per_batch | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests BatchSizesPreserveStrategiesAndValues, BatchedMeasurementAcceptsIterationCountsBeyondArrayLimits |
| TransactionMode, run_routine, Runtime::with_subtransaction | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests TransactionModesUseTheirExactBoundaries, BatchedMeasurementIncludesSubtransactionBoundary, BatchedSetupUsesSelectedTransactionBoundary; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction (rows written by the measured routine are rolled back) |
| BenchConfig defaults | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests AttributeUsesPgrxDefaults; invalid values: GT PgBenchmarkGeneratorTests RejectsInvalidBenchmarkContracts; RT PgBenchmarkTests RunnerRejectsInvalidConfiguration |
| execute_benchmark, Runtime::execute_guarded: setup, measurement and the failure result | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests RunnerReturnsNativeAotSafeDescriptorAndSamples, RunnerReturnsExplicitFailurePayload; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction (`Setup` creates the measured table; a backend `division by zero` becomes a failed result and exit code 1) |
| describe_benchmark | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests RunnerReturnsNativeAotSafeDescriptorAndSamples; GT PgBenchmarkGeneratorTests BenchmarkPublicationEmitsConfiguredBackendWrappers, BenchmarkSourceLinesUpdateWithoutRecomposition |
| module_path_has_benches: benchmarks only in `mod benches` | Rust-specific | Benchmarks are compiled only into benchmark publications: GT PgBenchmarkGeneratorTests OrdinaryPublicationExcludesBenchmarks; BT SdkPostgresSelectionTests TestAndBenchmarkPublicationsDefineTheirSymbols; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction (installation SQL has no `benches` schema) |
| build_criterion: warmup, sampling plan, sample count and measurement time | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests WarmupProducesCriterionCalibration, WarmupRejectsInvalidMeasurementsAndOverflow, AutomaticSamplingUsesCriterionLinearPlan, AutomaticSamplingKeepsCriterionBoundaryMode, AutomaticSamplingUsesCriterionFlatPlanForSlowRoutines, MeasurementRetainsEveryPlannedSample, MeasurementPreservesFailuresWithoutRetrying |
| parse_benchmark_output: estimates and samples | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests EstimatorsMatchCriterionArithmetic; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction (ten samples; slope or mean as the primary estimate) |
| collect_artifacts, materialize_baseline_artifacts, find_new_report_dir; tests find_new_report_dir_prefers_criterion_new_directory, materialize_baseline_artifacts_writes_criterion_base_layout, collect_artifacts_includes_change_estimates_when_present | Rust-specific | These handle Criterion's report files. Ankus keeps its own result document with the raw samples and passes it back as the baseline: RT PgBenchmarkTests RunnerComparesPersistedSamplesWithConfiguredResampling; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction. Criterion's Tukey outlier fences are not kept |
| parse_comparison, criterion_p_value, criterion_summary_from_change_estimate; tests criterion_summary_matches_expected_labels, criterion_p_value_with_rng_detects_large_regression, criterion_p_value_with_rng_is_high_for_identical_samples, parse_comparison_uses_persisted_baseline_artifacts | Covered | RT PgBenchmarkTests ComparisonSummariesFollowSignificanceAndNoise: all four summaries, a significant p-value for a doubled or halved time and a high p-value for identical distributions; RunnerComparesPersistedSamplesWithConfiguredResampling (persisted samples, the configured significance level and 95% intervals), ComparisonRejectsNonFiniteTStatistic |

### cargo-pgrx/src/command/bench.rs

Unless noted, the evidence is IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests
BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction, called the
bench test.

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resolve_args: positional `[pgXX] [benchname]` | Covered | `--pg` selects the server and an ordinal substring selects benchmarks: the bench test (`Success` selects two, `SuccessAddNumeric` one) |
| `--dbname` and the `<extension>_benches` default | Covered | The bench test uses the default database and `--database` |
| `--resetdb` | Covered | The bench test: a run with `--resetdb` finds no group to compare with, and the report then holds only that run |
| refresh_extension, `--cascade` | Covered | The bench test: a view on an extension function blocks the refresh with the hint to rerun with `--cascade`, and `--cascade` drops the view and runs. Ankus also creates the extension with `CASCADE` under `--cascade`, installing required extensions, where pgrx creates it plainly |
| ensure_persistent_schema, execute_benchmark_query, persist_benchmark_result | Covered | The bench test: measured writes are rolled back, results persist in `ankus_bench` afterward, and a report on an empty database creates no schema. Ankus stores one `jsonb` result per run rather than separate estimate, sample and artifact tables |
| discover_benchmarks, load_benchmark_descriptor | Covered | The bench test, through the `benches` descriptor functions |
| "no benchmarks discovered" error | Covered | IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction: a filter that matches nothing fails with "No benchmarks were discovered in the benches schema." |
| `--list` | Covered | IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction: `--list` names the selected benchmarks with their settings and measures nothing |
| default_group_name, collect_git_metadata | Covered | The bench test runs without `--group-name` in a Git work tree with an uncommitted tracked change: the group is named for the time and short commit, and records the commit, branch, dirty state and `git describe --always --dirty --tags` output. `GITHUB_SHA`, when set, supplies the commit instead of `git rev-parse HEAD` |
| resolve_compare_group | Covered | IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction covers automatic selection of the latest completed group, skipping a failed group and a group from another build configuration, a named group and an unknown named group. The other configuration is set in the stored group rather than by publishing a Debug build |
| insert_run_group, snapshot_pg_settings | Covered | Run groups record the extension version, configuration, PostgreSQL version, runtime identifier, command line, .NET SDK version, tool version and each setting's value, unit, source, source file, boot value and reset value; the bench test checks them after a database-level `work_mem`. Ankus keeps the settings as one `jsonb` object per group rather than a table, and its runtime identifier stands for pgrx's operating system and architecture columns |
| load_backend_pid, wait_before_starting_benchmarks; tests wait_defaults_to_zero, wait_parses_from_cli | Covered | The bench test: the PID is printed and the backend is observed while `--wait 10` holds the run; other runs start without waiting |
| format_wait_duration; test format_wait_duration_uses_singular_and_plural_units | Covered | `--wait` prints pgrx's waiting message to standard error: PT BenchmarkConsoleFormatTests WaitingMessageUsesSingularAndPluralUnits; the bench test's `--wait 10` run |
| mark_run_group_complete | Covered | The bench test asserts `completed`, `failed` and `partial` groups and that automatic comparison skips the failed one |
| load_missing_benchmarks (`missing_from_current`) | Covered | A compared run lists the baseline group's benchmarks that it did not run, in the console summary and in JSON `missing_from_current`: IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction; PT BenchmarkConsoleFormatTests RunningLineAndSummaryMatchPgrx |
| build_change_summary | Covered | A compared run says when a benchmark is new to the compared group or its baseline did not complete, in place of the change: PT BenchmarkConsoleFormatTests FailuresAndFlatResultsKeepTheirLines; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction. As in pgrx's console output, a failed current run prints only its error |
| `--json` summary, build_benchmark_summary | Covered | The bench test: the group, comparison group and each result, including a failed one |
| print_running_benchmark, print_completed_benchmark, print_summary and the duration, interval and percent formatters | Covered | Benchmarks print in pgrx's layout: the running line with settings, `time:`, `change:` with its p-value, the summary, `slope:`, `mean:` with std. dev., `median:` with med. abs. dev. and the group summary with ok and failed counts and missing benchmarks, using pgrx's units and precision (PT BenchmarkConsoleFormatTests; IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction) |
| parse_throughput, format_throughput_interval; tests throughput_interval_uses_time_estimate_to_compute_rate, throughput_without_interval_uses_decimal_units_when_requested | Covered | `[PgBenchmark(Throughput = ..., ThroughputPerIteration = ...)]` reports bytes, decimal bytes or elements per second with pgrx's units and interval order: PT BenchmarkConsoleFormatTests ThroughputUsesTheTimeEstimateToComputeRates (pgrx's two cases); RT PgBenchmarkTests RunnerReturnsNativeAotSafeDescriptorAndSamples; GT PgBenchmarkGeneratorTests RejectsInvalidBenchmarkContracts; the bench test prints a `thrpt:` line. pgrx's `Bencher` cannot set a throughput, so this goes beyond what pgrx can reach |
| `--report`, execute_report; test report_flag_parses_from_cli | Covered | The bench test: `--report` prints the history report, `--report --json` returns retained results, and an empty database reports that no history exists |
| validate_report_args; test report_rejects_run_only_flags | Covered | IT ToolCommandBenchmarkTests BenchRunsInBackendAndPersistsResultsOutsideMeasurementTransaction: `--report --list` fails naming the incompatible option. `--json` is accepted with `--report`, as `benchmarks.md` documents |
| load_recent_report_runs, load_report_baselines, load_nondefault_settings_for_groups, build_report_sections, drift_categories_for_run, print_history_report; test report_sections_omit_failed_runs_and_mark_drift | Covered | Each benchmark gets a section with its first successful run as the baseline, the ten most recent groups as bars with their change, a `*` and category list for configuration, PostgreSQL major version, runtime and non-default settings drift, and counts of omitted failed and estimate-less runs: PT BenchmarkHistoryReportTests SectionsOmitFailedRunsAndMarkDrift, DriftNamesEachBroadDifference, SectionsKeepTheFirstBaselineAndTheLastTenGroups, LongNamesAndZeroBaselinesStayAligned; the bench test, where a database-level setting marks a group as drifted and a filter limits the sections. Runtime drift stands for pgrx's Cargo features |
| `--cargo`; test cargo_flag_defaults_to_empty | Covered | Repeatable `--property` assignments reach the benchmark build: the bench test (`--property BenchmarkProbe=enabled`); IT ToolCommandPropertyTests ProjectCommandsRejectMalformedGlobalProperties includes `bench` |
| test cargo_flag_is_repeatable (values split on whitespace) | Different | Each `--property` is one literal assignment and is never split (`reference/cli.md`, "Pass MSBuild properties") |
| `--postgresql-conf` | Covered | The bench test passes `random_page_cost=1.5`; the group records it from the configuration file and the report marks it as settings drift. The parser is shared with `start` (IT ToolCommandClusterTests ClusterCommandsPreserveDataAcrossRestarts) |
| `--debug`, `--profile`, features, `--target`, `--package`, `--manifest-path` | Covered | `--configuration` (default `Release`), `--project` and `--property`: the bench test |
| Build and install before running | Covered | The bench test: PostgreSQL 18 stages the extension through `extension_control_path` without writing to the installation, and `--no-build` reuses the publication |

## cargo-pgrx tests

### cargo_flags_passthrough.rs

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cargo_flag_reaches_cargo_metadata | Covered | `--property` values reach project evaluation and every build step: IT ToolCommandPropertyTests ProjectGlobalPropertiesReachNativePublicationAndQueries (a conditional property selects the name `get` reads, then build, publish, schema, install and package); IT ToolCommandPropertyFlowTests ProjectGlobalPropertiesReachRunConnectAndRegression; malformed values fail before any work: IT ToolCommandPropertyTests ProjectCommandsRejectMalformedGlobalProperties |
| cargo_flag_whitespace_string_is_split | Different | Each `--property` is one literal assignment and is never split (`reference/cli.md`, "Pass MSBuild properties"): IT ToolCommandPropertyFlowTests ProjectGlobalPropertyQueriesPreserveLiteralValues |
| pgrx_build_flags_does_not_reach_cargo_metadata | Different | MSBuild has no build-only channel: properties apply to evaluation and compilation alike (`reference/cli.md`), as the first row's test shows |
| no_flags_does_not_break_cargo_metadata | Covered | Every command test without properties, for example IT ToolCommandTests PublishedInstalledAndPreloadedExtensionExecutesInPostgres |

### cargo_target_directory.rs

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| schema_uses_configured_target_directory | Covered | IT ToolCommandPropertyTests ProjectGlobalPropertiesReachNativePublicationAndQueries: with a custom configuration and `BaseIntermediateOutputPath`, `schema` and `schema --skip-build` print the same SQL, a third `schema --skip-build` from the project directory without `--project` and with a relative intermediate path prints it again, and the project gets no `obj` directory |
| package_uses_configured_target_directory | Covered | The same test packages with the custom configuration and intermediate root; packages include upgrade scripts: IT ToolCommandUpgradeTests InstallAndPackageCopyOnlyDeclaredExtensionFiles; IT ToolCommandPackageTests PackageBuildsConfiguredExtensionAndLoadsInPostgres |
| test_uses_configured_target_directory | Covered | IT ToolCommandTestRunnerTests TestCommandRunsSelectedBackendTests (`forwarded`): a forwarded output root receives the test host's and the fixture publication's build output. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` precedence is Rust-specific |

### cli_upgrade.rs

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upgrade_help_succeeds | Covered | IT ToolCommandTests InstalledToolProvidesHelp (`upgrade --help` lists `--to`) |
| upgrade_to_rejects_garbage, upgrade_to_rejects_empty | Covered | IT ToolCommandFrameworkUpgradeTests UpgradeInvalidRequestsPreserveAllFiles: `--to not-a-version` and `--to ""` fail and leave every file unchanged |

### install_pg_test_regression.rs

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| install_test_extension_handles_mid_stream_schema_sentinel | Rust-specific | The bug was in finding pgrx's sentinel inside a linker section. Ankus embeds one length-delimited schema section and validates it when reading: PT NativeSchemaSectionTests RejectsMissingAndDuplicateSections, RejectsEveryTruncatedPrefix; graph size limits: GT InstallationGraphEncodingTests InstallationGraphEncodingEnforcesExactByteLimit; a test publication installs and runs: IT ToolCommandBackendTests GeneratedBackendTestsDiscoverExecuteAndRollback |
| install_from_virtual_workspace_auto_detects_manifest_and_preserves_rustflags | Covered | IT ToolCommandTests InstallFromSolutionDirectorySelectsTheExtensionProject: `install` from a solution directory selects its one extension project beside a class library, and a constant from the solution's `Directory.Build.props` reaches the build, which fails without it. Solution selection also follows evaluated properties (ExtensionIdentitySelectsEvaluatedSolutionProject, ExtensionIdentitySkipsUnrelatedUnevaluableSolutionProject, DirectoryBuildResponsePropertiesSelectExtensionProject). The `--no-gc-sections` linker argument is Rust-specific |
| cargo_toml_path_uses_forward_slashes, command_output_path_match_accepts_escaped_windows_paths | Rust-specific | Helpers for writing `Cargo.toml` fixtures and matching Cargo's debug output; no counterpart |

### fixtures/

| pgrx case | Status | Ankus evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| package/ and workspace/ with upgrade.rs tests find_package_manifest, find_package_manifest_in_workspace | Covered | `--package` selects one project in a solution (IT ToolCommandFrameworkUpgradeTests UpgradeSelectsProjectAndImportedVersions); a missing solution project and an unknown `--package` name fail before any file changes (UpgradeInvalidRequestsPreserveAllFiles) |
| package/ and workspace/ with upgrade.rs tests process_package_manifest, process_workspace_manifest, process_workspace_package_manifest | Covered | IT ToolCommandFrameworkUpgradeTests UpgradePreservesUnrelatedVersionsAndFormatting, UpgradeSelectsProjectAndImportedVersions, UpgradeHonorsSharedImportSelection, UpgradeMixedCentralOverridesRestoreSelectedVersions |
| macos-universal-binary with object_utils.rs and schema.rs tests returns_none_for_valid_binary_without_schema_section, parses_universal_binary_slice, slice_unknown_architecture_returns_none, test_missing_schema_section_errors | Covered | PT NativeSchemaSectionTests SelectsUniversalArchitecture, RejectsMalformedUniversalImage (absent architecture records), RejectsMissingAndDuplicateSections. The tests build Mach-O images instead of storing a binary |
