# Ankus — pgrx → .NET Native AOT Port: Progress Tracker

Ankus is a faithful port of pgrx to idiomatic C# and .NET Native AOT. The port
is still in progress. Passing implemented subsets does not establish full parity.

## Goal and complete scope

Implement pgrx's runtime APIs, declaration macros, extension features, native
bindings, tooling, examples and testing contracts. Preserve PostgreSQL errors,
transactions, exact values, SQL NULL, type identity, encoding and native ownership.
Consumers use ordinary C# attributes, source generation, NuGet project SDKs,
`dotnet publish` and `dotnet test`, without runtime code generation or unbounded
reflection. Higher-level custom scan providers are additional Ankus scope.

Completion requires the supported PostgreSQL 13–18 and 19 beta contracts on
Linux x64, Windows x64, macOS ARM64 and macOS x64, including real published
extensions, backend recovery, complete suites and release/package validation.
The initial release is **0.1.0**; no NuGet packages are published yet.

The upstream inventory is pinned to pgrx **0.19.3**, commit
`fc91c63ebad11784647b50ee7e265c1fd9c9924f`. The refresh covers every release
change, including expanded headers and their source-derived maintenance command,
PG19 beta 4, CLI options, allocation cleanups, shared-memory lookup, reporting
interrupts and varlena safety. The pin and all seven header manifests already
match; matching inputs do not complete the release audit. See:

- [Complete requirement inventory](docs/contributing/evidence/parity-requirements.md): every inventoried command, API family, test corpus and release contract remains in scope.
- [pgrx 0.19.3 refresh gates](docs/contributing/evidence/parity-requirements.md#pgrx-0193-release-delta-and-refresh-gates): all eleven release commits, their .NET equivalents, existing evidence and remaining acceptance.

## .NET support and servicing plan

Repository `global.json` selects stable SDK **10.0.400** with
`rollForward: latestFeature` and prereleases disabled. The initial extension
target is **net10.0**. Installing another SDK does not silently change an
extension's selected compiler, target framework or embedded runtime.

The platform-fix milestone **bdb5d1c** selects embedded runtime and compiler host **10.0.12-ankus.4**,
based on runtime fork commit `d23f4e7374cd3878dc5696fbc26ee6ecdddde1ca` and paired
with the 10.0.12 Native AOT framework and compiler targets. Complete primary CI
passes with **ankus.4**; Intel acceptance also passes. Additional-version
acceptance remains in progress.
Servicing requires
immutable patched-runtime and compiler packages, matching compiler selection,
complete backend validation and extension rebuild/redeployment. Check current
upstream servicing before releasing 0.1.0.

| Runtime line | Evidence and remaining requirements |
| --- | --- |
| .NET 10 LTS | Patched runtime and complete primary-platform suites exist. Complete supported PostgreSQL/platform combinations and final release acceptance remain required. |
| .NET 11 STS | SDK 11 RC1 targeting net10.0 passes complete PostgreSQL 18.6/Linux x64 acceptance. This does not implement net11.0. Its own patched compiler/runtime, GA and cross-platform acceptance remain required. |
| Later LTS/STS releases | Repeat explicit compiler/runtime/RID and packed-consumer acceptance, following upstream support lifecycles and servicing supported majors. |

See the [public support policy](docs/src/content/docs/reference/dotnet-support.md)
and [maintenance/acceptance plan](docs/contributing/dotnet-support.md). Each
declared .NET major must have actual evidence; SDK or package configuration is
not runtime support proof.
The .NET 11 plan also requires compiler memory-safety acceptance for raw calls,
globals, callbacks and checked managed APIs. Typed pointer contracts and explicit
scalar-call unsafe contexts pass the current complete .NET 10 compositions;
that evidence does not establish the future .NET 11 contract.

## Implementation status

This matrix summarizes current conclusions. The complete inventory linked above
defines the full scope; family-level implementation is not API-by-API completion.

| Area | Verified implementation | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Errors and cancellation | Sticky query cancellation/FATAL, retained raw/memory errors, fail-fast backend access and explicit rollback recovery. Transaction-completion callback failures use a fixed-buffer emergency log path without PostgreSQL diagnostic allocation; it preserves the primary error and durable outcome. Abort-time FATAL remains FATAL while irreversible FATAL is promoted to PANIC. Primary-platform full CI passes. | Retain recovery guarantees and complete the version/platform matrix. |
| Workers and shared memory | Native signal globals, lifecycle/transaction boundaries and shared memory. Idle Wait recovers repeated real cancellation; transaction waits still abort and terminal reports remain sticky. Complete primary-platform CI passes. | Full source-contract and complete version/platform acceptance remain required. |
| Functions and callbacks | Scalar/array/SETOF/TABLE, triggers/events, lifecycle, native callbacks, operators/conversions and installation-schema search paths. | Full upstream declaration/option audit and complete version/platform evidence. |
| Aggregates and SQL graph | Static abstract aggregate capabilities, typed Requires/Before/SupportFunction references with per-contract diagnostics at the authored value, deterministic SQL provenance and extended module magic. Empty SQL dependency anchors and exact authored CR/CRLF values pass complete native acceptance. | Inventoried contracts and complete version/platform acceptance. |
| Generator caching | Detached equatable declaration/provider/reference models, stable declaration-header locations and cached dispatcher/C/SQL artifacts across multi-declaration body edits, unrelated member insertion and unrelated file insertion. Only selected SQL files are read, with the complete path catalog retained. | Broader precise diagnostics, useful semantic code fixes and final inventory audit remain required. |
| Values and ownership | Documented scalar, array, composite, temporal, JSON, network, geometry, custom codec and raw datum contracts. Interval equality, hashing and ordering agree with PostgreSQL while retaining exact components; complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining mapped/container contracts, parsing/formatting ergonomics and complete source-case mapping remain required. |
| Runtime performance | Owned binary PgNumeric, direct decimal coefficient encoding, constant-time fixed-width array indexing, and a measured native guard for allowlisted pure built-ins. Catalog-miss errors require actual rollback; real-resource regressions and complete primary-platform CI pass. Persistent in-backend benchmarks provide batching, transaction modes and statistical baseline comparisons. | Complete current guard supported-version acceptance. Extend that tier only where ownership proofs and measurements justify it. Never weaken error recovery to reduce overhead. |
| Native bindings | pgrx 0.19.3 inventories, matching PostgreSQL 19 beta 4 inputs and target-compiler ABI checks; typed pointers and ANKUS129 make raw caller obligations explicit. Complete current primary-platform compositions pass, with focused binding checks on all seven majors. | Full supported-major/platform tests and final inventory audit. |
| Development CLI | Version/project selection, installation/registration, cluster lifecycle, run/connect, test/regress/bench, property forwarding, environment selection, scriptable info and package prefixes. Benchmarks are measured inside PostgreSQL and retained in named comparison groups. `install --sudo`, `test --runas` and `regress --runas` follow cargo-pgrx with real-account evidence. | Persistent Windows diagnostic collection, run-as provisioning of the macOS and version runners, and remaining inventoried CLI/platform contracts. |
| .NET templates | Version-matched ordinary extension and worker templates reuse the CLI assets and pin local tools. Optional xUnit/NUnit consumers exercise managed and named backend cases, ignore reasons, worker processes and cleanup alongside default MSTest consumers. Complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining discovery contracts and complete version/platform acceptance. |
| API discoverability | Idiomatic attributed declarations, documented runtime APIs, named logging helpers and typed SPI interpolation. Compiler transport helpers are isolated in Ankus.CompilerServices and hidden from IntelliSense; complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining value/assertion helpers and final inventory audit. |
| Packages and release | MIT license, Brandon Williams copyright, author/repository/project metadata and deliberate SDK/runtime boundaries. | Full release gates and supported-platform packages before publishing 0.1.0. |
| Documentation and samples | Public guides, generated API pages, pgrx migration and backend-execution guidance; current status separated from historical evidence. All 37 of pgrx's examples map to runnable samples with backend integration tests. | Final usage/limitation review across samples and guides. |

The custom-type alignment review found no defect: variable-length PostgreSQL
types require at least four-byte datum alignment. Managed codec payload layout
is a separate contract, verified through copying/packed-field tests. Deriving
datum alignment from a CLR carrier or adding one/two-byte alignment would be
incorrect. See [the detailed review](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md#custom-datum-alignment-review).

## Current complete acceptance evidence

Primary CI runs all six modules against real published Native AOT extensions.
The latest successful primary CI source is **e0e469a**, with runtime **10.0.12-ankus.4**.
[CI 37825380597](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37825380597)
passes; [Docs run 37825380526](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37825380526)
also passes. Each platform completed all six modules with zero failures; no
primary job timed out. It is the first green primary run since **67c9cb5**.
A complete [Intel refresh](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37460600236)
also passes on source **e41c687**.

These results establish the named combinations, not full-port completion.

Additional-platform results below are older revisions. Refreshing them against
the current source remains required, alongside the never-covered combinations.

## Active validation and work

- Code-fix tests now compare the complete fixed document, not fragments of it.
  The exact comparisons exposed three defects: the injected-parameter fix left a
  space inside the brackets when it removed one attribute of several (`[ Keep]`,
  `[Keep ]`) and doubled the space where a list between comments disappeared, and
  on Windows the aggregate fix rewrote the existing line ending after the base
  list as CRLF. The injected-parameter fix now rebuilds the parameter's attribute
  lists itself, and the aggregate fix appends its capability by taking over the
  base list's trailing trivia instead of reformatting it. The 92 code-fix and
  guard tests pass on Linux and Windows.
- The guard tiers now have figures. `tests/Ankus.GuardTierBenchmarks` measures
  them with `ankus bench`, and on a PostgreSQL 18.6 release build a filtered log
  report costs 0.19 µs, a lightweight numeric parse or addition 0.60–0.72 µs, the
  same addition in an explicit subtransaction 1.19 µs, an SPI `SELECT 1` 2.89 µs
  and an invalid `TryParse` 5.51 µs, most of it the managed exception. The
  [guard tier measurements](docs/contributing/evidence/guard-tiers.md) also record
  13.23 and 16.15 assertion builds. Measuring them exposed a gap: before
  PostgreSQL 16, `TryParse` inside an explicit scope, which every benchmark
  iteration uses, could not recover invalid input, because input recovery opened
  its own subtransaction only when no scope was active. A scope already runs in a
  subtransaction, so input recovery now nests one there, in recoverable and
  atomic scopes alike. A new test parses each family's invalid text in both kinds
  of scope, and it and 125 related input, parallel, ownership and numeric tests
  pass on PostgreSQL 13.23, 16 and 18.6.
- The `Ankus` namespace now holds only the API extension authors use, the
  counterpart of `pgrx::prelude::*`, which the SDK imports implicitly. The
  registries, codecs and type writer that generated code calls moved to
  `Ankus.CompilerServices` beside the other generated-code helpers, and the
  System.Text.Json converters moved to `Ankus.Serialization`. The converters are
  no longer hidden: the value types still apply them through `[JsonConverter]`,
  and applications can add them to their own serializer options.
- `TryParse` of built-in numeric, date and time, network, geometry and range
  types no longer opens a subtransaction on PostgreSQL 16 and later: it calls
  the input function through PostgreSQL's soft-error interface and raises a
  failure only after the input function has returned, so the guard recovers it
  without rollback. It therefore also returns false inside transaction callbacks
  and parallel workers, where no subtransaction may start: the callback and
  parallel input tests now expect `false` and a committed transaction for all
  five families from 16, and the original SQLSTATE before. As with PostgreSQL's
  own `pg_input_is_valid`, only invalid input is soft; a hard error such as out
  of memory is no longer rolled back on 16 and later, and the native-fault
  ownership test now expects that. Log reports below ERROR skip the subtransaction too
  when no `emit_log_hook` is installed, since PostgreSQL's own formatting and
  client conversion hold nothing when they fail; both kinds of clean failure stay
  recovered in a parallel worker before 17 instead of being raised again when the
  function returns. A terminal cleanup report whose construction fails now has a
  test: the fault fixture fails the call into the report builder, and the backend
  still ends with the requested severity and transported message, FATAL after a
  read-only commit and PANIC after a durable one. A second test shows that a log
  hook failing during the report cannot make it recoverable: PostgreSQL promotes
  the hook's error to the pending FATAL.
- Evidence for this batch and the pending-error work: the full Linux x64 suite on
  PostgreSQL 18.6 ran 14,477 tests with 15 failures, and the Windows x64 suites on
  17.11 and 13.23 ran 14,477 each with 16 and 1. The failures were two existing
  tests that still expected the old input-recovery behavior on 16 and later, and
  on Windows a race in a test helper that read `postmaster.pid` while PostgreSQL
  was replacing it. With those updated, the affected input, ownership, parallel,
  callback and logging tests pass on Linux with PostgreSQL 18.6, 16 and 13.23
  (99 each, plus 208 broader on 18.6 and 13.23) and on Windows with 17.11 and
  13.23. The test extension's native bridge compiles for PostgreSQL 13, 16 and 18.
- A guarded call that caught its own error while PostgreSQL still had another
  error pending removed both, because PostgreSQL's error stack can only be
  flushed whole. A caller that cleans up before re-throwing, as logical
  replication's apply worker does, then reported `errstart was not called`
  instead of its own error. Guarded SPI, memory, logging, configuration-read and
  assign-hook calls now copy a pending error first and push it back after
  flushing their own. An empty ErrorContext proves none is pending, so ordinary
  calls skip the copy; otherwise the probe points `ErrorContext` at a private
  context while it runs, so its own error never resets memory a caller keeps
  beneath ErrorContext. Once no error is pending, leftovers of finished reports
  are released as PostgreSQL 19 does, so later calls take the fast path again. A
  C fixture repeats the apply worker's pattern with a savepoint abort callback
  whose warning a LATIN1 client cannot receive: before the fix the client saw
  `XX000: errstart was not called`, and now it sees the original `P0001` error.
- A worker started from a LATIN1 database now has a test: it logs non-ASCII text
  between transactions, catches a pre-commit callback's error after its
  transaction has ended, and survives two idle cancellations, with its report
  written to the log in LATIN1. The generator tests (4,773) and the 215 affected
  memory, callback, configuration, logging and worker integration tests pass on
  Linux x64 with PostgreSQL 18.6.
- Numeric, network and geometry values implement `IParsable<T>` and
  `ISpanFormattable`, and the six temporal types implement `IParsable<T>`, so
  generic .NET code and string interpolation use PostgreSQL's input and output
  rules. Format strings are rejected rather than reinterpreted, since PostgreSQL
  text has one canonical form; a backend test parses each kind through
  `T.Parse`. PostgreSQL downloads retry transient failures four times with
  backoff and report each retry. Version parsing accepts suffixes such as
  `11.2-FOO-BAR+`, as pgrx does, and schema selection warnings name the custom
  SQL's source line. pgrx's `value_struct_cast` and `value_union_cast` now run
  against the bindings generated from the server's own headers, which closes the
  last partial row of the [inline test mapping](docs/contributing/evidence/pgrx-inline-test-mapping.md).
  On Linux x64 with PostgreSQL 18.6 the full suite ran 14,471 tests: 14,416
  passed, 54 skipped and 1 failed, a new list test that wrongly expected a mocked
  native layer to return null. With that check moved to the backend-free NIL list
  test, the runtime module passes (2,424). The node and temporal integration tests
  also pass on PostgreSQL 13.23 (77), which runs the `Value` branch.
- **dd530d4** and **a842f7d** pass the Windows x64 suites on PostgreSQL 17.11 and
  13.23, run concurrently (**14,446** total each; **14,402** passed; 44 skips;
  zero failures; **24m46s** and **24m03s**).
- A cancelled CI job left its test servers running, and the runner then killed
  them outright, so each kept its System V shared memory segment. macOS allows
  32; the MacBook had leaked 18 from runs cancelled on 2026-10-07, and `initdb`
  then failed with "No space left on device". Runner cleanup now finds the
  postmasters carrying the job's `RUNNER_TRACKING_ID` and shuts them down so
  PostgreSQL removes its own segment. Checked on macOS and Linux with a tagged
  server: it stopped and released its segment, and other servers kept running.
  The 18 leaked segments were removed; the Intel Mac had none.
- A fresh audit of every finding in the private review notes against the current
  code finds most fixed. This batch closes several that remained: a relation
  opened inside `Spi.Connect` now belongs to the statement that opened the
  session, as in pgrx, instead of being released with the session's recovery
  subtransaction. `PgAssert` gives backend tests checks that name expected and
  actual values, and its `ThrowsSqlState` runs work in a subtransaction so a test
  can inspect an error and continue. Projects that enable implicit usings get
  `using Ankus` from the SDK. The `dotnet new` templates accept
  `--extension-name`, matching `ankus new`. The numeric guide notes pgrx's
  `XX000`. Still open from the audit: version and platform cells CI never runs,
  and binding catalogs still taken from pgrx's generated bindings.
- **2b841a3** passes the complete Linux x64 suite on PostgreSQL 18.6 with run-as
  (**14,442** total; **14,391** passed; 51 skips; zero failures; **41m03s**). Its
  Windows x64 suites on PostgreSQL 17.11 and 13.23, run concurrently at package
  concurrency 20 (**14,443** total each; **14,397** passed; 44 skips; **38m25s**
  and **36m34s**), failed only the bench test's cleanup: Git marks the object files
  of the repository that test creates read-only, and Windows would not delete
  them. **f1a6895** removes that repository with its attributes cleared, and the
  bench test then passes on both majors.
- `PgPropertyRunner` and `PgGenerators` port pgrx's `PgTestRunner`: a property
  runs against 256 generated inputs inside the backend, each in its own
  subtransaction, so a PostgreSQL error is a failing input whose work rolls back
  while the run continues. Failing inputs shrink by editing the recorded random
  choices, as Hypothesis does, so composed generators shrink without extra code;
  integers are a sign and a magnitude and reach their exact boundary. The report
  names the smallest input, its error and the seed. .NET has no Microsoft-owned
  property-testing package, so the generators are Ankus's own. pgrx-unit-tests'
  eight temporal `proptests` now run through it with pgrx's raw-value strategies.
- `ankus bench --report` prints pgrx's history report: a section per benchmark
  with its first successful run as the baseline, the ten most recent groups as
  bars with their change, drift marks for build configuration, PostgreSQL major,
  runtime and non-default settings, and counts of omitted failed runs. Run groups
  now record the extension and .NET SDK versions, the command line, the tool
  version, the Git commit, branch, dirty state and describe output, and each
  setting's unit, source and boot and reset values. A refresh blocked by a
  dependent object names `--cascade`, and `--wait` prints pgrx's waiting message.
  The bench test now covers default group names, `--postgresql-conf`, `--cascade`,
  `--resetdb`, partial and failed groups and comparison filtering. Test clusters
  can run under Valgrind (`ankus test --valgrind`), and every Valgrind start
  passes PostgreSQL's `valgrind.supp`, which `ankus init` now keeps in the PGXS
  tree. The cluster locale is asserted per platform, and an unknown
  `upgrade --package` fails before any change. Messages a test raises that
  contain `TMSG: ` reach its output live, as pgrx echoes them. Installing from a
  solution directory and `schema` from the project directory with a relative
  intermediate path are tested. `[PgBenchmark]` can report throughput
  in pgrx's units, which pgrx's own `Bencher` cannot set. The tooling mapping now
  has 82 covered rows, 12 documented differences, 24 Rust-specific rows and no
  gaps or partials.
- **921113f** passes complete suites on this repository's validation machine:
  Windows x64 on PostgreSQL 17.11 and 13.23 run concurrently at package
  concurrency 20 (**14,410** total each; **14,368** passed; 42 skips; zero
  failures; **41m44s** and **41m51s**) and Linux x64 on PostgreSQL 18.6 with
  run-as (**14,410** total; **14,359** passed; 51 skips; zero failures; **43m56s**),
  all three at once. Its primary CI
  ([37933668208](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37933668208))
  passes Linux x64 on 18 (18m), Windows x64 on 17 (21m) and macOS ARM64 on 18
  (16m). Its PostgreSQL 19 beta 4 rerun
  ([37934631721](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37934631721))
  passes Linux x64 with the PGLZ sample fix (**14,410** total; **14,359** passed;
  51 skips; zero failures; 25m job), completing PostgreSQL 13 through 17 and 19
  on the version matrix after 5b72b18's run. The platform version run on **10c1391**
  ([37917953859](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37917953859))
  passes macOS ARM64 on PostgreSQL 15 (23m) and 16 (21m) and Windows x64 on 13
  (1h11m). Windows x64 on 18 failed two cleanups that deleted a cluster directory
  while a stopped server still held handles: the regression-prerequisite cleanup
  fixed in **ac6486e**, and the development-diagnostics cleanups, which now use
  the same retrying delete.
- Generated custom-type storage now serializes `Guid`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`,
  `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset` and `TimeSpan` members, as System.Text.Json does
  and as pgrx's serde storage does for its date type. JSON text uses
  System.Text.Json's formats; CBOR uses the registered UUID (37), full-date (1004)
  and date/time (0) tags where they exist. Runtime tests pin the bytes and text
  and reject other spellings; seeded pgrx `RandomData` values with unsigned
  64-bit and date-list members survive table storage, compression, arrays and
  every exchange path in the backend.
- A second source-case mapping covers pgrx's compile-fail, `todo` and UI cases,
  its testing framework, its benchmark runner and `cargo-pgrx/tests` (203 cases in
  118 rows: 66 covered, 14 partial, 3 gaps, 11 deliberate differences and 24
  Rust-specific at the time; see the entry above for the current counts). The test fixture now creates the extension with `CASCADE`, as
  pgrx's does, so an extension that `requires` another starts; a failed test's
  report includes the server's account of its backend when that process died;
  `ankus bench` prints pgrx's running line, intervals, change and group summary,
  with benchmarks missing from the current run and why a comparison is
  unavailable; and new tests pin the comparison summaries, concurrent test
  isolation, process-exit cleanup, the logging defaults and the composite and
  text-array signatures pgrx keeps in its `todo` corpus. The ranked gaps start with Valgrind runs of test clusters and the
  benchmark history report.
- `PgMemoryContext.CreateFlatArray<T>` builds a zeroed PostgreSQL array of a
  fixed-size scalar in place, the counterpart of pgrx's `FlatArray::new_zeroed_in`;
  it rejects zero-length dimensions, more than six dimensions and PostgreSQL's
  element and 1 GB allocation limits before allocating. `PgArrayView` and
  `PgArrayView<T>` expose the native SQL NULL bitmap like pgrx's `RawArray::nulls`.
  With these, every case in pgrx's unit-test corpus maps to a passing Ankus test,
  a documented difference or a Rust-specific guarantee.
- More of pgrx's unit tests now run in the backend: a backend ERROR's managed
  stack trace, seeded temporal round trips checked against `*_send` bytes, the
  installed signature matrix read back from `pg_proc`, a typed
  `PgArrayView<bool>`, a trigger opening its relation, an array-of-composite
  field set in code, the current memory context's parent, an untracked worker's
  termination, a parameter named like its function and a test-only function
  under `#if ANKUS_TESTS`. Test publications define `ANKUS_TESTS` and benchmark
  publications `ANKUS_BENCHMARKS`, like pgrx's `pg_test` feature. A generator
  test compiles every declaration kind beside types named `System`, `Ankus`,
  `Spi` and other names generated code uses. SPI conversion errors now name the
  source value's type.
- **ac6486e** passes the complete Windows x64 suite on PostgreSQL 17.11 (**14,382**
  total; **14,340** passed; 42 skips; zero failures; **58m** while the machine also
  ran PostgreSQL 13 and Linux suites and focused runs). Its PostgreSQL 13.23 run
  failed only two regression-prerequisite cleanups, which deleted a directory
  while a stopped server's handles were still closing; that cleanup now waits as
  PostgreSQL's own Windows `unlink` does. Its Linux run failed two cases on
  30-second client timeouts while five suites shared the machine; the next
  revision is validated without that contention.
- **805783b** passes complete Windows x64 suites on PostgreSQL 17.11 (**14,312**
  total; **14,270** passed; 42 skips; zero failures; **40m** while the machine also
  ran CI and Linux) and Linux x64 on PostgreSQL 18.6 with run-as (**14,261** passed;
  51 skips; zero failures; **43m**). Its PostgreSQL 13.23 Windows run failed only
  the benchmark payload test: a constant-time routine could measure zero ticks on
  Windows's 100 ns stopwatch under load. **10c1391** gives that test measurable work.
  **5b72b18** also passes Linux x64 on PostgreSQL 18.6 with run-as (**14,203**
  passed; 51 skips; **17m**) and CI
  ([37909292198](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37909292198):
  Linux 25m, Windows 29m, macOS 15m while sharing hosts with local validation).
  The version matrix rerun with the socket fix
  ([37909296064](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37909296064))
  passes PostgreSQL 13 through 17; 16 and 17 had failed on the socket path, and 13
  and 14 took **70m** on the flex runners. PostgreSQL 19 failed one pglz sample
  case: its beta defaults `default_toast_compression` to LZ4 when built with it,
  so the stored size no longer matched the PGLZ estimate. That case now sets the
  column to PGLZ on PostgreSQL 14 and later.

- `System.Text.Rune` maps to `varchar`, as Rust's `char` does in pgrx. Generated
  arguments, results, `Rune[]` and `PgArray<Rune?>` (`varchar[]`), SPI parameters,
  cells and edited rows all carry the scalar value as character text, and returned
  arrays keep the `varchar` element type. pgrx's `rt_char`, `rt_array_char`
  (including U+10FFFF and NULL elements) and `takes_char` values pass through all
  eight SPI paths in the backend. Where pgrx takes the first character and reads
  empty text as SQL NULL, a `Rune` requires exactly one scalar value: empty text,
  `'ab'`, a base letter with a combining accent and padded `bpchar` fail with
  38000 and the backend continues. Runtime tests pin the UTF-8 bytes and the
  unpaired-surrogate message.
- Two more mapped gaps are closed in the backend. A background worker whose wait
  loop ends on termination commits a final transaction that the launching
  backend reads after shutdown, as pgrx's `bgworker` does. pgrx's composite
  default and variadic cases run with and without arguments, including NULL
  rows, and an explicit function cast between two composite types installs,
  converts and keeps strict NULL. Borrowed-text set functions read table columns
  stored compressed inline, out of line and compressed out of line, and 10,000
  composites built from one descriptor stream to the client and through SPI.
  Methods whose only parameter is a nullable custom-text record or enum run on
  SQL NULL from non-strict functions, and a `string? = null` default is executed
  omitted, supplied and NULL.
- A configuration check that throws on its boot value while a library load
  registers the setting now fails that load with an ERROR carrying the managed
  message, matching pgrx and a C hook's ERROR; previously it was a rejection,
  which PostgreSQL turns into FATAL for a boot value. Only registration changes:
  returned rejections, reload checks and ordinary `SET` keep their policy, and
  the same backend loads the library again afterwards. `SHOW ALL` omits a
  no-show setting, and an unlabelled GUC enum member is set by its C# name and
  restored in parallel workers.
- Complete Windows x64 suites on **5b72b18** pass PostgreSQL 17.11 and 13.23
  concurrently at package concurrency 20 (**14,254** total each; **14,212** passed;
  42 skips; zero failures; **34m** each while sharing the machine).

- Three pgrx capabilities are added. `PgDiagnostic.Domain` and `PgException.Domain`
  carry the message domain of C's `ereport_domain` and pgrx's `ereport_domain!`:
  the native report passes it to `errstart`, and captured ErrorData returns it,
  so a caught error reports `test_extension_domain` after crossing PostgreSQL and
  backend errors report `postgres-<major>`. `PgLog.Write(level, $"...")` uses a new
  interpolated-string handler that evaluates nothing when PostgreSQL would not
  report the level, as pgrx's logging macros skip their arguments; at default
  thresholds DEBUG is skipped and WARNING evaluated. JSON and JSONB aggregate
  states run with strict, immutable, parallel-safe transitions. Direct calls pass
  and return path and polygon values, a borrowed empty bytea reports zero bytes,
  and double infinities, NaN and numeric-to-real overflow match SQL casts exactly,
  including PostgreSQL 13's rejection of numeric infinity. The pgrx mapping's
  remaining gaps are `Rune` to `varchar`, background-worker SPI after termination,
  composite VARIADIC/DEFAULT execution and a few smaller cases; `Rune` has since
  been added.
- The dedicated Intel macOS runner passes its complete suite on **a3e39c8**
  ([additional platforms 37892336665](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37892336665), **1h15m**).
  The Linux version matrix on the same revision
  ([37892281684](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37892281684))
  passes PostgreSQL 14 and 15. PostgreSQL 16, 17 and 19 fail the same 32
  consumer-fixture cases on newly added runners whose work directories are long:
  without an `ankus test` session, a fixture placed its Unix socket under `TMPDIR`
  and exceeded PostgreSQL's 107-byte socket path. The socket directory now stays
  under `TMPDIR` only while the longest socket path fits and otherwise uses `/tmp`,
  as PostgreSQL's own test clusters do; direct tests cover the byte boundary,
  including multibyte names. PostgreSQL 13's job stopped when its runner service
  received a shutdown signal. The matrix is to be rerun with the fix.

## Remaining work order

The accepted declaration milestones have complete primary-platform CI evidence.
The earlier editor composition passes its full native suite and replacement primary CI.
The current cold-load/reload correction also passes complete Linux/18.6 acceptance;
its replacement primary CI passes all three complete platform suites.
The Intel diagnostic retry exposed six path-related failures; the corrected
complete Intel suite now passes. An explanation of the earlier hosted-runner
disconnect and remaining version/platform acceptance are still required.

1. Resolve discovered correctness and CI failures before accepting affected work. Finish the remaining declaration/source-case audits. Malformed AssemblyRef handling and the owner index already pass all eight regressions in the current complete suite.
2. Complete every pgrx 0.19.3 release-delta gate, including deterministic header discovery/regeneration, newly exposed native contracts, all CLI/configuration/output forwarding and allocation/shared-memory/varlena audits. Refresh evidence against the corrected current source.
3. Verify the dedicated Intel runner with a complete live run and finish supported-major/platform coverage, including Intel macOS and the macOS 15/16 library-suffix boundary.
4. Complete declaration diagnostics/code fixes, API discoverability and unsafe raw-call contracts.
5. Use the in-backend baseline to finish measured hot-path improvements that preserve recovery and ownership guarantees.
6. Close remaining CLI, account/privilege and platform-installation contracts.
7. Complete framework/discovery support, parsing/formatting helpers, representative samples and documentation.
8. Complete .NET servicing and every release requirement in the full inventory before publishing 0.1.0. If .NET 11 reaches GA first, complete its acceptance for that release; preview validation does not block the initial .NET 10 release.

Continue independent work while CI runs. Before every commit and push, check and
record previous run outcomes, including live runs, and resolve reported failures.
Keep this file current; append detailed implementation evidence to the archive
with a clear tested revision, platform/version, outcome and any remaining scope.
