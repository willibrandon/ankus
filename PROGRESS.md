# Ankus — pgrx → .NET Native AOT Port: Progress Tracker

Ankus is a faithful port of pgrx to idiomatic C# and .NET Native AOT. The port
is still in progress. Passing implemented subsets does not establish full parity.

## Goal and complete scope

Implement pgrx's runtime APIs, declaration macros, extension features, native
bindings, tooling, examples and testing contracts. Preserve PostgreSQL errors,
transactions, exact values, SQL NULL, type identity, encoding and native ownership.
Consumers use ordinary C# attributes, source generation, NuGet project SDKs,
`dotnet publish` and `dotnet test`, without runtime code generation or unbounded
reflection. Higher-level custom scan providers are additional Ankus scope.

Completion requires the supported PostgreSQL 13–18 and 19 beta contracts on
Linux x64, Windows x64, macOS ARM64 and macOS x64, including real published
extensions, backend recovery, complete suites and release/package validation.
The initial release is **0.1.0**; no NuGet packages are published yet.

The upstream inventory is pinned to pgrx **0.19.3**, commit
`fc91c63ebad11784647b50ee7e265c1fd9c9924f`. See:

- [Complete requirement inventory](docs/contributing/evidence/parity-requirements.md): every inventoried command, API family, test corpus and release contract remains in scope.
- [Original phase plan](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md#phase-plan): the full implementation requirements and original milestones.
- [Implementation and acceptance history](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md): complete retained evidence, including failures and later corrections. Historical completion states may be superseded.
- [Extension-author documentation](docs/src/content/docs/) and [development prerequisites](docs/contributing/development.md).

## .NET support and servicing plan

Repository `global.json` selects stable SDK **10.0.400** with
`rollForward: latestFeature` and prereleases disabled. The initial extension
target is **net10.0**. Installing another SDK does not silently change an
extension's selected compiler, target framework or embedded runtime.

The platform-fix milestone **bdb5d1c** selects embedded runtime and compiler host **10.0.12-ankus.4**,
based on runtime fork commit `d23f4e7374cd3878dc5696fbc26ee6ecdddde1ca` and paired
with the 10.0.12 Native AOT framework and compiler targets. Complete primary CI
passes with **ankus.4**; Intel acceptance also passes. Additional-version
acceptance remains in progress.
Servicing requires
immutable patched-runtime and compiler packages, matching compiler selection,
complete backend validation and extension rebuild/redeployment. Check current
upstream servicing before releasing 0.1.0.

| Runtime line | Evidence and remaining requirements |
| --- | --- |
| .NET 10 LTS | Patched runtime and complete primary-platform suites exist. Complete supported PostgreSQL/platform combinations and final release acceptance remain required. |
| .NET 11 STS | SDK 11 RC1 targeting net10.0 passes complete PostgreSQL 18.6/Linux x64 acceptance. This does not implement net11.0. Its own patched compiler/runtime, GA and cross-platform acceptance remain required. |
| Later LTS/STS releases | Repeat explicit compiler/runtime/RID and packed-consumer acceptance, following upstream support lifecycles and servicing supported majors. |

See the [public support policy](docs/src/content/docs/reference/dotnet-support.md)
and [maintenance/acceptance plan](docs/contributing/dotnet-support.md). Each
declared .NET major must have actual evidence; SDK or package configuration is
not runtime support proof.
The .NET 11 plan also requires compiler memory-safety acceptance for raw calls,
globals, callbacks and checked managed APIs. Typed pointer contracts and explicit
scalar-call unsafe contexts pass the current complete .NET 10 compositions;
that evidence does not establish the future .NET 11 contract.

## Implementation status

This matrix summarizes current conclusions. The complete inventory linked above
defines the full scope; family-level implementation is not API-by-API completion.

| Area | Verified implementation | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Errors and cancellation | Sticky query cancellation/FATAL, retained raw/memory errors, fail-fast backend access and explicit rollback recovery. Primary-platform full CI passes. | Preserve these guarantees in every remaining API and performance change; complete the version/platform matrix. |
| Workers and shared memory | Native signal globals, lifecycle/transaction boundaries and shared memory. Idle Wait recovers repeated real cancellation; transaction waits still abort and terminal reports remain sticky. Complete primary-platform CI passes. | Full source-contract and complete version/platform acceptance remain required. |
| Functions and callbacks | Scalar/array/SETOF/TABLE, triggers/events, lifecycle, native callbacks, operators/conversions and installation-schema search paths. | Full upstream declaration/option audit and complete version/platform evidence. |
| Aggregates and SQL graph | Static abstract aggregate capabilities, typed Requires/Before/SupportFunction references, deterministic SQL provenance and extended module magic. | Remaining inventoried contracts and complete version/platform acceptance. |
| Generator caching | Detached equatable declaration/provider/reference models, declaration-relative locations and cached dispatcher/C/SQL artifacts across multi-declaration body edits and unrelated file insertion. Only selected SQL files are read, with the complete path catalog retained. | Broader precise diagnostics, useful semantic code fixes and final inventory audit remain required. |
| Values and ownership | Documented scalar, array, composite, temporal, JSON, network, geometry, custom codec and raw datum contracts. Interval equality, hashing and ordering agree with PostgreSQL while retaining exact components; complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining mapped/container contracts, parsing/formatting ergonomics and complete source-case mapping remain required. |
| Runtime performance | Owned binary PgNumeric, direct decimal coefficient encoding, native recovery/allocator tests and measured query comparisons. | Appropriately guarded pure operations, array costs and permanent benchmarks. Never weaken error recovery to reduce overhead. |
| Native bindings | pgrx 0.19.3 inventories, matching PostgreSQL 19 beta 4 inputs and target-compiler ABI checks; typed pointers and ANKUS129 make raw caller obligations explicit. Complete current primary-platform compositions pass, with focused binding checks on all seven majors. | Full supported-major/platform tests and final inventory audit. |
| Development CLI | Version/project selection, installation/registration, cluster lifecycle, run/connect, test/regress, property forwarding, environment selection, scriptable info and package prefixes. | Persistent Windows diagnostic collection, account/privilege selection, in-backend benchmarking and remaining inventoried CLI/platform contracts. |
| .NET templates | Version-matched ordinary extension and worker templates reuse the CLI assets and pin local tools. Optional xUnit/NUnit consumers exercise managed and named backend cases, ignore reasons, worker processes and cleanup alongside default MSTest consumers. Complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining discovery contracts and complete version/platform acceptance. |
| API discoverability | Idiomatic attributed declarations, documented runtime APIs, named logging helpers and typed SPI interpolation. Compiler transport helpers are isolated in Ankus.CompilerServices and hidden from IntelliSense; complete primary-platform CI passes. | Remaining value/assertion helpers and final inventory audit. |
| Packages and release | MIT license, Brandon Williams copyright, author/repository/project metadata and deliberate SDK/runtime boundaries. | Full release gates and supported-platform packages before publishing 0.1.0. |
| Documentation and samples | Public guides, generated API pages, pgrx migration and backend-execution guidance; current status separated from historical evidence. | Every inventoried representative sample and final usage/limitation review. |

The custom-type alignment review found no defect: variable-length PostgreSQL
types require at least four-byte datum alignment. Managed codec payload layout
is a separate contract, verified through copying/packed-field tests. Deriving
datum alignment from a CLR carrier or adding one/two-byte alignment would be
incorrect. See [the detailed review](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md#custom-datum-alignment-review).

## Current complete acceptance evidence

All six TRX reports were independently checked for each current primary
platform, including the **04f0a8a / ankus.4** CI run, and the editor composition.
The latter also passes Release with zero
warnings/errors (**3m04.15s**), API freshness (**238 pages / 2,757 members**),
site build (**286 pages, 3.97s**) and site checks with zero diagnostics. Its
50 source identities match the tested draft, validator and promoted source.
The older major-version runs prove their named revisions; they do not establish
current-source acceptance for every advertised combination.

Earlier platform results, timings and failures remain in the
[evidence archive](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md#progress-snapshot-before-editor-acceptance).
[Docs 37114971196](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37114971196)
passes on 3a06bd9. The editor change is committed as **21d586f** and the version
workflow as **7f58d03**. Replacement [CI 37117515450](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37117515450)
passes quality, all runtime jobs and all three complete suites. [Docs 37117515453](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37117515453)
passes.

## Active validation and work

- **596a8af** fixes persistent diagnostic collection and cluster cleanup,
  canceled shutdown retry, idle interrupt cancellation, SPI quoting and parameter
  boundaries, raw caller checks, editor fixes and per-item backend-test rejection.
  Complete Linux/18.6 acceptance passes **11,816 total / 11,768 passed /
  48 platform skips / zero failures** in **50m23s**. All 137 recorded authored
  inputs remain unchanged. Corrected Windows/13.23 generator, build and native
  lifecycle modules pass; Release, API freshness and site checks pass.
  [Primary CI 37169593738](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37169593738)
  passes quality, all runtime jobs and all three complete platform suites.
  All six report modules were independently verified for each platform.
  [Docs CI 37169593785](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37169593785)
  passes. Original failed attempts and subsequent corrections remain archived.
- Generator discovery now uses semantic attribute indexes and independently
  cached reference metadata. Physical SQL line attribution is separate from
  semantic composition; unchanged trees retain their declaration indexes.
  Four source-edit regressions fail before correction. Complete repository
  generator acceptance passes **3,427/3,427**; complete Linux/18.6 acceptance
  passes **11,830 total / 11,782 passed / 48 platform skips / zero failures**
  in **50m29.932s**. All six reports are independently verified; all 1,648
  recorded authored inputs remain unchanged. Release and API freshness pass.
  This change is uncommitted; platform CI remains required.
- CLI environment and invocation-selection drafts pass 17 real process cases
  against PostgreSQL/18.6; 13 fail against the prior implementation. Packaged
  publication, solution and template acceptance remain required before promotion.
- Current-runtime Linux/13–17 and 19 acceptance is green on **c24297f** in
  [version CI 37154140634](https://github.com/willibrandon/ankus/actions/runs/37154140634).
  Later review fixes still require refreshed version/platform evidence.
- Persistent generated `emit_log_hook` coverage exposed diagnostic cleanup
  after PostgreSQL resets its error context. The callback header now survives
  that reset and is released after unwinding. Focused Linux/18.6 acceptance
  passes **52/52**, including chaining, nested reporting, managed failures,
  native failure before the handler and same-session recovery. The first
  combined complete run stopped before its integration report and is retained
  as incomplete. Replacement complete Linux/18.6 acceptance is running against
  1,650 recorded authored inputs; this fix remains uncommitted.
- Remaining review work includes precise diagnostics and useful code fixes,
  CLI environment/name contracts, appropriately guarded pure operations and
  permanent backend benchmarks, representative samples and final platform
  acceptance. Detailed outcomes and superseded states belong in the
  [evidence archive](docs/contributing/evidence/port-history.md#status-snapshot-before-the-23-commit-follow-up-review).

## Remaining work order

The accepted declaration milestones have complete primary-platform CI evidence.
The editor composition passes its full native suite and replacement primary CI.
The Intel diagnostic retry exposed six path-related failures; the corrected
complete Intel suite now passes. An explanation of the earlier hosted-runner
disconnect and remaining version/platform acceptance are still required.

1. Resolve discovered correctness and CI failures before accepting affected work.
2. Finish the Intel timing milestone and complete supported-major/platform coverage, including Intel macOS and the macOS 15/16 library-suffix boundary.
3. Complete declaration diagnostics/code fixes, API discoverability and unsafe raw-call contracts.
4. Establish faithful in-backend benchmarks, then finish appropriate guard/array improvements with recovery tests and measured comparisons.
5. Close remaining CLI, account/privilege, benchmark and platform-installation contracts.
6. Complete framework/discovery support, parsing/formatting helpers, representative samples and documentation.
7. Complete .NET servicing and every release requirement in the full inventory before publishing 0.1.0. If .NET 11 reaches GA first, complete its acceptance for that release; preview validation does not block the initial .NET 10 release.

Continue independent work while CI runs. Before every commit and push, check and
record previous run outcomes, including live runs, and resolve reported failures.
Keep this file current; append detailed implementation evidence to the archive
with a clear tested revision, platform/version, outcome and any remaining scope.
