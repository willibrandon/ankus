# Engineering apps

Ankus repository automation uses .NET 10 file-based apps. Run an app from the
repository root with `dotnet run --file`.

| App | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Ankus.Ci.cs` | Validate, build, test, pack, and publish Ankus and its pinned Native AOT runtime. |
| `Ankus.SqlStates.cs` | Regenerate or check the named SQLSTATE catalog from pinned PostgreSQL source tags. |
| `Ankus.Oids.cs` | Regenerate or check the version-aware built-in OID catalog from pinned pgrx sources. |
| `Ankus.Bindings.cs` | Regenerate or check native declarations, node cast graphs, header manifests and attribution from pinned pgrx bindings. |
| `Ankus.Templates.cs` | Stage the shared extension and background-worker scaffolds for the version-matched template package. |
| `Ankus.BuildTimings.cs` | Read individual binding-task durations and cache outcomes from retained MSBuild binary logs without exposing command arguments. |

`Ankus.Ci.cs` provides these commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `metadata` | Validate and export the pinned runtime identity. |
| `runtime-info` | Validate and print the checkout's runtime repository, commit and matching package/compiler versions locally. |
| `release-metadata` | Validate a release tag and export release metadata. |
| `quality` | Install PostgreSQL headers, build Ankus and validate generated API and site documentation. |
| `runtime-build` | Build and stage one runtime for CI. |
| `runtime-pack` | Pack a staged runtime for CI. |
| `runtime-test` | Use a staged runtime to run the complete unit and PostgreSQL integration test suites. |
| `runtime-test-build` | Prepare the staged runtime's PostgreSQL toolchain and build all test projects before saving CI caches. |
| `windows-toolchain` | Select the latest supported Visual Studio installation with C++ x64 tools and export its developer environment to later CI steps. |
| `runtime-test-run` | Run every already-built test module using the PostgreSQL and compiler environment prepared by `runtime-test-build`. |
| `header-frontend-check` | Check an explicit Clang executable for the declaration-only frontend required by header collection. |
| `postgresql-check` | Check an explicit PostgreSQL 13–19 `pg_config` for its selected major and server headers without installing packages. |
| `unit-test` | Build and run the five unit test modules. |
| `prepare-reports` | Copy test results and server logs with private runner identifiers removed before artifact upload. |
| `release-managed` | Pack the managed NuGet packages. |
| `release-runtime` | Build and pack one platform runtime package. |
| `publish` | Validate and publish the complete NuGet package set. |

Native Linux/macOS runtime builds also execute the fork's bounded host-shutdown
probes before staging a payload. They require normal process exit and managed
thread cleanup, including mutex abandonment, GC and finalizer drain. A macOS
cross-build compiles its payload but requires separate execution on that
architecture; it does not claim native shutdown test evidence.

Use `--` before command arguments:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Ci.cs -- metadata
```

`runtime-test` installs and selects LLVM 20 on hosted Linux and macOS, and uses
dedicated Linux/macOS runners' Clang on PATH or the Windows runner's LLVM installation.
It prints the compiler version and verifies
`-skip-function-bodies` support before building or running tests. The platform
default Clang can be too old even when Native AOT compilation works. Check a local
compiler without installing or changing anything:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Ci.cs -- header-frontend-check /path/to/clang
```

Platform CI separates `runtime-test-build` and `runtime-test-run` so it can save
the native binding cache before the complete suite starts. The build command
exports the selected PostgreSQL installation and compiler path to subsequent
GitHub Actions steps. `AnkusBindingCacheDirectory` selects the restored cache;
normal header preprocessing, native ABI verification and content checks still
run before reuse. The full suite remains in one platform job with a 60-minute
timeout. `runtime-test` retains the combined local command.
Test commands write each module's TRX results and durations to
`artifacts/test-results`; platform CI uploads available reports on every outcome.

Owner-triggered main-branch pushes and manual runs use the dedicated runners
labelled `ankus-linux-x64`, `ankus-macos-arm64` and `ankus-windows-x64`. Both the original actor and
the actor requesting a rerun must be the repository owner. Pull requests and
other actors use GitHub-hosted runners; all external contributors require
workflow approval. The same actor checks apply to release runtime builds.
These workflow conditions route normal jobs; review workflow edits before
approving an external run because approval also permits its changed workflow.
Keep the runner services online before dispatching dedicated jobs.
CI selects the latest stable .NET 10 SDK allowed by `global.json`.

The `Additional platforms` workflow runs the complete PostgreSQL 18 suite on a
GitHub-hosted Intel macOS runner weekly and on manual dispatch. This covers the
release architecture unavailable on the dedicated machines. Runtime, NuGet and
binding caches are saved before tests so later runs reuse successful preparation.
Each run retains test results and timings; the job limit remains 60 minutes.
Successful execution is required before counting Intel macOS as validated.

The `PostgreSQL versions` workflow runs complete Linux x64 suites for PostgreSQL
13–17 and 19 weekly. Manual dispatch selects one major, including 18, or all six
additional majors. A separate runner labelled `ankus-linux-versions-x64` keeps
these checks off the primary CI queue. Both actors must be the repository owner
and the selected ref must be `main`; there is no pull-request trigger.
Each major runs the complete suite in its own 60-minute job, sequentially on
that runner. Failures do not cancel the other majors or supersede existing runs.
Install each selected server and matching development headers before dispatch;
PostgreSQL 19 uses its current prerelease until a stable release is available.
Check an installation before enabling the workflow:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Ci.cs -- postgresql-check 19 /path/to/pg19/bin/pg_config
```

The preparation command verifies that `pg_config` matches the selected major,
including beta and release-candidate identifiers. Completed native test reports,
not the matrix definition or this prerequisite check, establish version coverage.
`ANKUS_LINUX_VERSIONS_PACKAGE_TEST_CONCURRENCY` sets the compatibility runner's
default package-consumer slots independently of primary CI. Configure the runner
privacy secret before uploading reports. macOS and Windows version coverage
remain separate acceptance requirements.

Timed-out runs also upload available redacted failure logs. Test builds print
an MSBuild performance summary and retain a unique binary log in
`artifacts/test-logs` for local investigation. Binary logs can contain machine
paths and environment values; they remain local and are not uploaded.
Hosted test runs also print each completed case and its duration. These records
remain in the job log if a timeout prevents the final integration TRX from being
written. Captured test output is printed for failures.

Hosted report preparation also replays retained build logs into
`build-timings.log`, containing only target/task names and durations. This covers
fixture publication and package-consumer logs still present after a timeout;
unfinished logs are labelled explicitly. Raw binary logs remain local.
The report also records each completed `binding-sources`, `binding-compile` and
`binding-link` task separately, including its success and cache outcome. These
durations include helper startup and work inside that task; concurrent task
durations must not be added together as elapsed build time. Incomplete tasks
have no proven duration or outcome. The reader accepts one or more local binary
logs and performs no builds or backend calls.
Hosted test builds print these binding timings immediately after the initial
solution build, so the first measurements do not depend on test completion.

The additional-platform workflow accepts `package-test-concurrency` on manual
dispatch, matching the primary workflow. Compare the same commit with complete
test suites when tuning it; a timed-out subset is not validation.

The Linux service runs under its own unprivileged account. Provision PostgreSQL
18 with server headers, Clang 20 or later with matching libclang, and the .NET
runtime build prerequisites, Valgrind and matching libc debug symbols once
(`valgrind` and `libc6-dbg` on Debian/Ubuntu). Keep Clang's `bin` directory on the service
PATH. On macOS, provision Homebrew's `llvm`, `postgresql@18`, `cmake`, `ninja`
and `pkgconf`; run the runner as a user LaunchAgent. Keep the session logged in
and the machine awake for queued work. Dedicated jobs validate the installed
tools and do not run package-manager commands or require sudo. Runtime cache
keys distinguish dedicated Linux/macOS builds from hosted builds so each
toolchain is actually exercised. Runner labels identify platform roles and can
move to replacement machines without changing workflows.

Keep personal names and paths out of runner labels and work directories. Before
assigning a personal machine its runner label, update the repository secret
`ANKUS_RUNNER_PRIVATE_IDENTIFIERS` with one private identifier per line, including
its machine name and any personal user/home paths. CI and release jobs reference
that secret so GitHub masks startup logs. `prepare-reports` separately creates
redacted copies of TRX results and server logs; only those copies are uploaded.
Keep this secret current when replacing a runner. Raw reports remain local.

Windows needs PowerShell 7, Git, current Visual Studio C++
tools, CMake, Ninja, Python, LLVM 20 or later with matching libclang, and
PostgreSQL 17.11 or later in major 17 with server headers and import libraries.
Set `PGROOT` to the dedicated installation root when the machine's default
installation differs. The CI build checks the required maintenance version
before compiling; aligned no-OOM allocation tests require PostgreSQL 16.15,
17.11 or 18.6 for their respective majors.

The service PATH must include Windows PowerShell for the runtime build and
Git's `usr/bin` directory for the cache action's `tar`/`gzip` pair. Keep Git's
Unix tools after the system tool directories. The `windows-toolchain` command
requires Visual Studio 2022 17.9 or later and queries `vswhere` for the C++
component, preventing unrelated products such as SQL Server Management Studio
from winning discovery. Its developer environment puts the selected MSVC
compiler and linker first.

The dedicated runner keeps its SDK installation, NuGet packages, temporary
files and work directory under its own storage root. Configure
`DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR`, `DOTNET_ROOT`, `DOTNET_CLI_HOME`, `NUGET_PACKAGES`, `TEMP`
and `TMP` for its service account. Native binding entries persist in
`runner.tool_cache/ankus-binding-cache` and retain normal content and ABI
validation. Self-hosted jobs reuse these local caches; hosted jobs continue to
restore and save GitHub caches. All platform suites remain complete and
unsharded with the same 60-minute job limit. Workflows do not automatically
cancel earlier runs; jobs queue while their dedicated runner is busy.

`ANKUS_PACKAGE_TEST_CONCURRENCY` controls package-consumer test slots and accepts
any positive integer, with three as the fixture default. CI's manual
`package-test-concurrency` input overrides it for a comparison run. The repository
variables `ANKUS_WINDOWS_PACKAGE_TEST_CONCURRENCY`,
`ANKUS_LINUX_PACKAGE_TEST_CONCURRENCY` and `ANKUS_MACOS_PACKAGE_TEST_CONCURRENCY`
select each dedicated runner's normal
setting independently. Compare complete suites at the same commit, SDK and
PostgreSQL version with equivalent cache conditions before raising that setting;
record elapsed time, test outcomes and whether the run started with cold caches.

Source and managed binding caches have separate **2 GiB** idle-entry budgets.
`ANKUS_BINDING_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` overrides each budget. Eviction uses the normal
cross-process leases and leaves active builds alone. Native linker objects are
retained until maintenance can establish that no dependent build is using them.
Remove obsolete experiment checkouts and completed test artifacts after retaining
the compact evidence needed for the current change; avoid keeping duplicate
runtime source trees and historical binary logs indefinitely.

See the [.NET file-based app documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk/file-based-apps)
for SDK behavior.

Regenerate SQLSTATE constants from an existing read-only PostgreSQL checkout:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.SqlStates.cs -- /path/to/postgres
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.SqlStates.cs -- /path/to/postgres --check
```

The app reads `src/backend/utils/errcodes.txt` at the pinned PostgreSQL 13–18 and
19 beta tags listed in its source. It makes no network requests or changes to
the reference checkout. The generated union retains native aliases and names
removed from newer server versions. Update the tag list when refreshing the
catalog, then regenerate the API documentation from its XML comments.

Regenerate built-in OID values and native names from an existing read-only pgrx checkout:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Oids.cs -- /path/to/pgrx
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Oids.cs -- /path/to/pgrx --check
```

The app reads PostgreSQL 13–19 catalogs at the pgrx commit pinned in its source.
It preserves per-version membership and native renames; one enum member represents
each numeric value. These catalogs follow pgrx's constant-name heuristic and are
not a list of every built-in database object. The app makes no network requests
and does not modify the reference checkout.

Regenerate the native declaration catalogs using the same read-only checkout:

```text
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Bindings.cs -- /path/to/pgrx
dotnet run --file ./eng/Ankus.Bindings.cs -- /path/to/pgrx --check
```

The catalogs retain fields, typedefs, enums and pgrx's node inheritance/alias
rules for PostgreSQL 13–19. Separate raw catalogs retain foreign function
signatures, global mutability, callback aliases, variadic arguments and original
linkage, including pgrx-specific C shims. The raw catalogs also retain unevaluated
reference constants; these include platform-dependent values and must not be
used as target measurements. Native sizes, offsets and target constants must
be established using the selected server headers.
The app invokes the `Ankus.Build binding-catalogs` command; parsing and catalog
generation stay inside the build tool without exposing its internals.
See the [catalog inventory](../src/Ankus.Build/Bindings/README.md) for the pinned
declaration counts and remaining runtime binding scope.

The same command refreshes each major's pgrx header include manifest and the
upstream license notice. These inputs are packaged with the build tool so an
installed SDK does not need a pgrx checkout to measure a server's native layouts.

For layout development, compile and run the selected header probe:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-layouts 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-layouts/pg18
```

The command discovers selected-header fields before writing `native-layout.c`,
its executable, raw observations and validated `native-layout.json`.
`native-node-availability.json` lists reference fields absent from those headers.
It measures every node and its present embedded value
dependencies, including unnamed types reached through named fields, arrays and
flexible tails, and checks
all node tags against the pinned major. Pointer and C long widths, plain-char
signedness, byte order, sizes, alignments and field offsets come from the selected
headers and compiler. Named enum widths, signedness and every constant are also
validated. The probe runs on the build host; it does not establish a
cross-compilation ABI. An optional fourth argument selects the C compiler; on
Windows a fifth argument supplies semicolon-separated native library directories.
A sixth argument selects the expected runtime identifier and a seventh passes
the compiler target triple. The actual compiler target must match the requested
runtime identifier.

Promoted anonymous members are checked through their enclosing declarations.
Independent probes compile complete headers, including implementation headers,
and link only definitions reached by the probe. Unused backend functions need
no standalone implementation; missing dependencies in executed checks still fail
linking. Compile-time assertions and executable bitfield checks remain enabled.
The pinned pgrx 0.19.3 inventory, OIDs and PostgreSQL 19 SQLSTATE inputs all use
19 beta 4. Complete platform/version validation remains required.

To emit managed declarations and their companion project, use `binding-sources`
with the same arguments, followed by optional Clang executable and libclang paths.
The native layout compiler remains separate from the Clang declaration frontend.
The command collects the complete node dependency graph, checks the independent
node/enum observations and emits one companion containing all reached native
declarations. Large temporary AST files are removed after workers exit, including
on failure. A failed collection does not replace a previous companion source.
The SDK invokes this command before C# compilation,
builds the generated `Ankus.NativeBindings.csproj`, and references its assembly.
The assembly name includes a hash of the measured declarations so consumers
built against the same contract share native type identity. Generated source
retains its timestamp when unchanged, and normal project clean removes the
companion artifacts. Compiler/header inputs are measured again on each build.

For raw-call development, put one catalog function name per line in a text file
and verify its native signature against an installed server:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-signatures functions.txt 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-signatures/pg18
```

The arguments after the function list match `binding-layouts`, including optional
compiler, Windows library directories, runtime identifier and target triple.
The command writes `native-signatures.c`, its executable, raw observations and
validated `native-signatures.json`. C11 generic-selection static assertions check complete prototypes;
the probe measures fixed parameter and result storage without calling backend
functions. Native typedef names remain intact so target headers determine widths.
Nested callback declarations, const-qualified pointers and arrays retain C
declarator precedence. pgrx shim linkage selects the corresponding header function,
without requiring a pgrx-specific export in the PostgreSQL server.

Unknown/duplicate names, incompatible prototypes, unavailable header declarations
and incomplete observations fail explicitly. The probe does not establish export
availability, a managed calling convention, pointer ownership or an error guard.
Some reference declarations still need target-derived type/prototype information,
including anonymous C typedefs, platform types and qualifiers lost in Rust. A PostgreSQL major match
alone does not prove that every installed-header function matches the catalog.
Variadic signatures retain only their fixed arguments; promoted call-site arguments
still require generation. Guarded managed calls and hook registration remain open.

To collect authoritative types from the selected headers, put catalog function
and/or global names in a text file, one per line:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-header-types symbols.txt 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-header-types/pg18
```

This developer command requires `clang` on Linux/macOS or `clang-cl.exe` on
Windows. Optional arguments select the Clang executable, Windows library
directories, expected runtime identifier and compiler target triple, in that
order. Windows uses the Visual Studio and SDK include directories. Collection
uses a frontend only, without linking or running target code; matching headers,
compiler includes and target configuration are still required.

Header collection requires Clang 20 or later with the declaration-only
`-skip-function-bodies` frontend option. Select that compiler explicitly or put
it on `PATH`; an older platform-default Clang does not support this command.

The command writes `native-header-types.c`, the compiler's
`native-header-types.ast.json`, reconstructed `native-header-checks.c`, compiler
output in `native-header-checks.txt`, and a normalized `native-header-types.json`.
The AST is a development artifact containing local header paths; the normalized
contract excludes source paths and compiler pointer identities. Its target records
the exact PostgreSQL version, runtime identifier, pointer width, byte order and
Clang major. Its numeric model records plain-char signedness, `wchar_t` size and
signedness, floating radix, and the precision and exponent limits of `float`,
`double` and `long double`. These compiler observations distinguish numeric
representations that have identical object byte sizes. The type graph retains
native typedefs and anonymous records/enums,
qualifiers at each pointer level, fixed/incomplete arrays, both written and
adjusted parameter types, callbacks, variadic/prototype distinctions and no-return
metadata. Functions also retain parameter names and linkage; globals retain
their declared types and thread-local status.
Records and enums retain whether a complete declaration is available; implicit
compiler tags without an exposed declaration keep that state unknown.

Clang inspects declarations and constant expressions without compiling inline
implementation bodies, which can depend on the server's original compiler dialect.
Warnings remain errors. It checks reconstructed declarations against the same headers before
the command writes the final contract. Unsupported type kinds/calling conventions,
invalid observations, target mismatches and compiler errors fail explicitly.
Existing final contracts survive failures before that final write; intermediate
diagnostic files may be replaced. Unlike the reference-prototype probe, collection
can retain minor-release prototype changes, native volatile qualifiers and
anonymous typedefs directly from the selected installation.

Header types do not establish native record layouts, scalar widths, exported
symbol availability, managed calling conventions, pointer ownership or backend
error guards. Integrating these facts with layout measurement, managed call
generation, global access and hook registration remains port work. The consumer
SDK's existing node layout generation is unchanged.

No-return metadata reports an annotation in the selected declaration or type.
It is not inferred from a function's name or implementation. For example,
PostgreSQL 17's MSVC headers omit the `proc_exit` annotation, while PostgreSQL 18
declares it with C11 `_Noreturn`. An absent annotation does not prove that the
function returns.

To measure storage from those authoritative types, run:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-storage symbols.txt 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-storage/pg18
```

This command accepts the same optional Clang/toolchain arguments as
`binding-header-types`, collects the semantic contract, then evaluates constants in
`native-storage.c` with the same frontend. It does not execute a target program.
Unevaluated prototype checks and storage expressions do not call PostgreSQL
functions or require backend exports. The observed PostgreSQL version, runtime,
pointer width, byte order, Clang major and numeric model must exactly match the
collected contract.

`native-storage.ast.json` retains the compiler output and `native-storage.txt`
contains the normalized observations. Its version-2 header carries every numeric
identity field; regenerate earlier observations instead of reusing them. The validated
`native-storage.json` retains the header contract and ordered measurements for
fixed parameters, non-void results and globals. Each value records byte size,
alignment, array element stride and integer/enum signedness where applicable.
Alignment can exceed a typedef's size. Incomplete arrays have a null total size
with measured alignment and stride. Opaque records/enums have null size and
alignment; they are not represented as zero-sized objects. A pointer to an opaque
type still has measured pointer storage. A non-void opaque result remains a
result entry with unknown storage, distinct from a void result.
Large selections use batches of 256 symbols with numbered C/AST diagnostic files;
every batch retains the same 512 MiB compiler-output limit and must independently
match the selected target before the final combined contract is written.

Missing, duplicate, extra, contradictory or malformed observations fail before
the final storage contract is written. Intermediate type/diagnostic artifacts may
be replaced. These measurements do not classify a managed aggregate ABI, supply
record fields, establish pointer ownership, promote variadic call-site arguments,
or implement guarded calls and hooks.

To collect the complete transitive record graph for selected symbols, run:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-records symbols.txt 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-records/pg18
```

It accepts the same optional compiler, Windows library directories, runtime and
target arguments as `binding-header-types`, followed by an optional absolute
`libclang` library path. Empty strings retain the defaults for earlier optional
arguments. Install the matching library with the compiler: `libclang-20-dev`
beside `clang-20` on Linux, Homebrew `llvm@20` on macOS, or the Windows LLVM
installer. Automatic discovery uses the selected compiler's resource directory,
so compiler shims retain their selected toolchain. A library from an incompatible
compiler build cannot read its serialized AST and fails explicitly.

The command first validates the semantic symbol contract, then saves
`native-header-records.ast` using exactly the same compiler driver, includes,
target and warning settings. A separate process loads that AST and collects
record metadata; it does not reinterpret the headers with different compiler
options. Cancellation terminates the worker and waits for its exit. The AST and
worker request/observation files are diagnostic artifacts that can contain local
paths. The final `native-records.json` couples the existing symbol signatures with
a validated graph whose identities are numeric indices, not native addresses or
source paths. A failed operation preserves the previous final record contract.

The graph retains declared and canonical types, typedef annotations, exact native
size/alignment, array/vector extents, function ABI shapes, struct/union/enum
identity, ordered physical fields, anonymous containers, bit offsets and widths,
flexible arrays and exact signed/unsigned enum values up to 64 bits. Unsupported
enum representations fail instead of truncating values. Anonymous typedefs do
not acquire fabricated C tag names. Padded vectors and over-aligned typedefs
retain their actual storage. Incomplete declarations have unknown storage;
pointers to them still have measured pointer storage. Callback ABI observations
and compiler-printed annotations accompany the richer existing signature
contracts; they do not replace written parameter and declaration metadata.

These facts do not yet classify managed aggregate calls, establish exports or
ownership, transport callbacks across error boundaries, generate promoted
variadic arguments, or implement raw globals and hooks. The consumer SDK's node
generation is unchanged; the complete PostgreSQL-major/platform matrix remains
required port work.

To generate checked native call bodies for a list of fixed-prototype functions:

```text
dotnet run --project src/Ankus.Build -c Release -- binding-call-sources symbols.txt 18 /path/to/pg_config artifacts/binding-calls/pg18
```

This accepts the same arguments and compiler/library prerequisites as
`binding-records`, followed by an optional native body compiler. Clang collects
the declarations; native body compilation defaults to MSVC on Windows, matching
the SDK, and to the selected Clang elsewhere. An explicit MSVC executable must
target the measured architecture and numeric model; generated checks reject a
mismatch, including changed char signedness or long-double precision. Both
compilation stages retain warnings as errors. It writes `native-calls.c` after
compiling the complete generated bodies, including their calls, against the
selected headers. A compiler
failure or cancellation preserves the previous final source. Declaration-only
inspection remains separate from complete-body validation.

Each `ankus_native_call_<symbol>` body accepts native argument addresses and exact
byte lengths, plus a result destination. It checks the complete envelope before
calling the function. Argument addresses must satisfy the measured native
alignment and hold valid C object representations with live referenced storage.
Pointer values remain borrowed, including null pointers where the underlying
native function permits them. The C compiler performs the actual call with its
native scalar/aggregate ABI; there is no managed aggregate calling-convention
guess. Result bytes are copied only after the native function returns. Empty
records retain the selected compiler's size, including zero where applicable.

These bodies are an internal prerequisite for guarded raw bindings. They must
execute beneath the native PostgreSQL error guard on the backend thread, with
owned diagnostic transport and managed unwinding outside that guard. They are
not directly callable managed imports. Callback addresses here refer to native
callbacks; generated managed callback guards and lifetimes remain required.
Variadic and unprototyped calls need explicit call-site type/promotion handling;
globals are not function calls. Those selections and incomplete by-value storage
fail explicitly. Export discovery, guard/consumer integration and the complete
PostgreSQL-major/platform matrix remain required port work.

These declarations provide native fields, enums, embedded values, inline arrays
and explicit flexible-tail access. Checked node ownership/casting/formatting APIs
are available through the runtime; typed pointer/callback fields remain port work.
