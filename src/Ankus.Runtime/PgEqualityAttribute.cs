/// Requires PgType, PgEnum, or a PgDatumType mapping with a reader. A mapped writer is not required.
/// Equality and any mapped reader must be immutable and parallel safe; equality must be an equivalence relation.
/// Generated functions are strict and never pass SQL NULL to managed comparisons.
/// Add PgOrdering or PgHashing to generate compatible default index operator classes.
/// Generated objects use the mapped SQL type's schema; fixed-schema objects prevent extension relocation.
