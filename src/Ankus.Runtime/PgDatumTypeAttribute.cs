/// <summary>
/// Maps a managed type to an existing PostgreSQL representation through an explicit datum converter.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This declaration generates conversion registration, not type definitions or input/output functions.
/// The converter implements IPgDatumReader&lt;T&gt;, IPgDatumWriter&lt;T&gt;, or both for this exact managed type.
/// A default generic declaration is a template selected by fully constructed roots in supported generated
/// signatures or exact managed PgSqlTypeProvider declarations. Each selected construction must have an
/// exact reader or writer interface on its supplied or inferred closed converter.
/// An open generic converter definition is closed at compile time from its exact reader/writer interface
/// patterns. Every parameter, including containing-type parameters, must have one unambiguous assignment
/// satisfying the C# constraints. No runtime reflection or open-ended registration is generated.
/// An explicit managed-type declaration selects one closed construction and registers a local root even
/// without a generated signature. It takes precedence over the optional default declaration on that type.
/// Exact declarations can assign distinct SQL identities and converters to different closed constructions.
/// Supported paths are scalar and array generated callbacks, set/TABLE and aggregate slots, declared SPI/function
/// parameters, typed SPI scalar and catalog/native-address function results, and explicit PgDatum.Read&lt;T&gt; calls.
/// One array layer uses the scalar converter with exact element and array identity, preserving NULL and shape.
/// Value-type mappings can add PgRangeType to compose the same converter into finite PgRange&lt;T&gt; bounds
/// and arrays of those ranges. Range and scalar SQL identities and ownership remain independent.
/// Readable mappings may declare PgEquality, PgOrdering and PgHashing; generated helpers require no writer.
/// Native-address calls retain the caller's responsibility for the actual result type and representation.
/// Ordinary SPI/tuple row conversions are not supported.
/// A reader must return independent managed data; retaining a checked PgDatum does not detach its storage.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="name">The exact unquoted PostgreSQL type identifier.</param>
