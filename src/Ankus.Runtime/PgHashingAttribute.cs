/// Generates a PostgreSQL hash support function and default hash operator class from IPgHashable.
/// Enum declarations hash their numeric value as eight little-endian bytes with PgHash.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Requires PgType, PgEnum, or a readable PgDatumType mapping and a same-type equality operator,
/// generated with PgEquality or declared with PgOperator. A mapped writer is not required.
/// Non-enum types must implement IEquatable of the declared type and IPgHashable. Hashes must agree with equality
/// and remain stable across processes, platforms and extension versions. Generated functions are strict,
/// immutable and parallel safe. Changing the hashing contract requires rebuilding dependent indexes.
/// Mapped readers must also provide stable, immutable and parallel-safe logical keys. Generated objects use the
/// mapped SQL type's schema; a fixed schema prevents extension relocation. PostgreSQL validates existing default
/// classes and permissions, and resolves a domain's default index class through its base type.
/// </remarks>
